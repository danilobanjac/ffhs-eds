      "<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/\">first article</a> of this series, we discussed communal computing devices and the problems they create–or, more precisely, the problems that arise because we don’t really understand what “communal” means. Communal devices are intended to be used by groups of people in homes and offices. Examples include popular home assistants and smart displays like the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod, and many others.&nbsp; If we don’t create these devices with communities of people in mind, we will continue to build the wrong ones.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ever since the concept of a “user” was invented (which was probably later than you think), we’ve assumed that devices are “owned” by a single user. Someone buys the device and sets up the account; it’s their device, their account.&nbsp; When we’re building shared devices with a user model, that model quickly runs into limitations. What happens when you want your home assistant to play music for a dinner party, but your preferences have been skewed by your children’s listening habits? We, as users, have certain expectations for what a device should do. But we, as technologists, have typically ignored our own expectations when designing and building those devices.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This expectation isn’t a new one either. The telephone in the kitchen was for everyone’s use. After the release of the iPad in 2010 <a href=\"https://furbo.org/2010/04/29/communal-computing/\">Craig Hockenberry discussed the great value of communal computing but also the concerns</a>:</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Communal computing requires a new mindset that takes into account users’ expectations. If the devices aren’t designed with those expectations in mind, they’re destined for the landfill. Users will eventually experience “weirdness” and “annoyance” that grows to distrust of the device itself. As technologists, we often call these weirdnesses “edge cases.” That’s precisely where we’re wrong: they’re not edge cases, but they’re at the core of how people want to use these devices.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "<h2>Identity</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>All of the problems we’ve listed start with the idea that there is one registered and known person who should use the device. That model doesn’t fit reality: the identity of a communal device isn’t a single person, but everyone who can interact with it. This could be anyone able to tap the screen, make a voice command, use a remote, or simply be sensed by it. To understand this communal model and the problems it poses, start with the person who buys and sets up the device. It is associated with that individual’s account, like a personal Amazon account with its order history and shopping list. Then it gets difficult. Who doesn&#8217;t, can’t, or shouldn’t have full access to an Amazon account? Do you want everyone who comes into your house to be able to add something to your shopping list?</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In addition to individuals, we need to consider the groups that each person could be part of. These group memberships are called “pseudo-identities”; they are facets of a person’s full identity. They are usually defined by how the person associated themself with a group of other people. My life at work, home, a high school friends group, and as a sports fan show different parts of my identity. When I’m with other people who share the same pseudo-identity, we can share information. When there are people from one group in front of a device I may avoid showing content that is associated with another group (or another personal pseudo-identity). This can sound abstract, but it isn’t; if you’re with friends in a sports bar, you probably want notifications about the teams you follow. You probably don’t want news about work, unless it’s an emergency.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are important reasons why we show a particular facet of our identity in a particular context. When designing an experience, you need to consider the identity context and where the experience will take place. Most recently this has come up with work from home. Many people talk about ‘<a href=\"https://mike-robbins.com/tedxberkeley/\">bringing your whole self to work</a>,’ but don&#8217;t realize that “your whole self” isn’t always appropriate. Remote work changes when and where I should interact with work. For a smart screen in my kitchen, it is appropriate to have content that is related to my home and family. Is it appropriate to have all of my work notifications and meetings there? Could it be a problem for children to have the ability to join my work calls? What does my IT group require as far as security of work devices versus personal home devices?</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What is most important about Contextual Integrity is that privacy is not about hiding information away from the public but giving people a way to control the flow of their own information. The context in which information is shared determines what is appropriate.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

It may be completely acceptable for my friend to have a weird photo of me, but once it gets posted on a company intranet site it violates how I want information (a photo) to flow. The recipient of the data has changed to something I no longer find acceptable. But I might not care whether a complete stranger (like a burglar) sees the photo, as long as it never gets back to someone I know.</p>\n",

      "<p>For communal use cases, the sender or receiver of information is often a group. There may be&nbsp; multiple people in the room during a video call, not just the person you are calling.

When a house was only visible to people who walked down the street that was one thing, but when anyone in the world can access a picture of a house, that changes the parameters in a way that causes concern. Most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262646/ibm-didnt-inform-people-when-it-used-their-flickr-photos-for-facial-recognition-training\">IBM used Flickr photos that were shared under a Creative Commons license to train facial recognition algorithms</a>.

      "<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.metaobject.com/2021/06/glue-dark-matter-of-software.html\">Glue: the Dark Matter of Software</a>, Marcel Weiher asks why there&#8217;s so much code. Why is Microsoft Office 400 million lines of code? Why are we always running into the truth of Alan Kay&#8217;s statement that &#8220;Software seems &#8216;large&#8217; and &#8216;complicated&#8217; for what it does&#8221;?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Weiher makes an interesting claim: the reason we have so much code is Glue Code, the code that connects everything together. It&#8217;s &#8220;invisible and massive&#8221;; it&#8217;s &#8220;deemed not important&#8221;; and, perhaps most important, it&#8217;s &#8220;quadratic&#8221;: the glue code is proportional to the square of the number of things you need to glue. That feels right; and in the past few years, we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of the skyrocketing number of dependencies in any software project significantly more complex than &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; We can all add our own examples: the classic article <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf\">Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</a> shows a block diagram of a system in which machine learning is a tiny block in the middle, surrounded by all sorts of infrastructure: data pipelines, resource management, configuration, etc. Object Relational Management (ORM) frameworks are a kind of glue between application software and databases. Web frameworks facilitate gluing together components of various types, along with gluing that front end to some kind of back end. The list goes on.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Weiher makes another important point: the simplest abstraction for glue is the Unix pipe (|), although he points out that pipes are not the only solution. Anyone who has used Unix or a variant (and certainly anyone who has read–or in my case, written–chunks of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/\">Unix Power Tools</a>) realizes how powerful the pipe is. A standard way to connect tools that are designed to do one thing well: that&#8217;s important.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But there&#8217;s another side to this problem, and one that we often sweep under the rug. A pipe has two ends: something that&#8217;s sending data, and something that&#8217;s receiving it. The sender needs to send data in a format that the receiver understands, or (more likely) the receiver needs to be able to parse and interpret the sender&#8217;s data in a way that it understands. You can pipe all the log data you want into an awk script (or perl, or python), but that script is still going to have to parse that data to make it interpretable. That&#8217;s really what those millions of lines of glue code do: either format data so the receiver can understand it or parse incoming data into a usable form. (This task falls more often on the receiver than the sender, largely because the sender often doesn&#8217;t—and shouldn&#8217;t—know anything about the receiver.)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From this standpoint, the real problem with glue isn&#8217;t moving data, though the Unix pipe is a great abstraction; it&#8217;s data integration. In a discussion about blockchains and medical records, Jim Stogdill once said &#8220;the real problem has nothing to do with blockchains. The real problem is data integration.&#8221; You can put all the data you want on a blockchain, or in a data warehouse, or in a subsurface data ocean the size of one of Jupiter&#8217;s moons, and you won&#8217;t solve the problem that application A generates data in a form that application B can&#8217;t use. If you know anything about medical records (and I know very little), you know that&#8217;s the heart of the problem. One major vendor has products that aren&#8217;t even compatible with each other, let alone competitors&#8217; systems. Not only are data formats incompatible, the meanings of fields in the data are often different in subtle ways. Chasing down those differences can easily run to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lines of code.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Pipes are great for moving data from one place to another. But there&#8217;s no equivalent standard for data integration. XML might play a role, but it only solves the easy part of the problem: standardizing parsing has some value, but the ease of parsing XML was always oversold, and the real problems stem more from schemas than data formats. (And please don&#8217;t play the &#8220;XML is human-readable and -writable&#8221; game.) JSON strikes me as XML for &#8220;pickling&#8221; JavaScript objects, replacing angle brackets with curly braces: a good idea that has gotten a lot of cross-language support, but like XML neglects the tough part of the problem.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Is data integration a problem that can be solved? In networking, we have standards for what data means and how to send it. All those TCP/IP packet headers that have been in use for almost 40 years (the first deployment of IPv4 was in 1982) have kept data flowing between systems built by different vendors. The fields in the header have been defined precisely, and new protocols have been built successfully at every layer of the network stack.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But this kind of standardization doesn&#8217;t solve the N squared problem. In a network stack, TCP talks to TCP; HTTPS talks to HTTPS. (Arguably, it keeps the N squared problem from being an N cubed problem.) The network stack designs the N squared problem out of existence, at least as far as the network itself is concerned, but that doesn’t help at the application layer. When we&#8217;re talking applications, a medical app needs to understand medical records, financial records, regulatory constraints, insurance records, reporting systems, and probably dozens more. Nor does standardization really solve the problem of new services. IPv4 desperately needs to be replaced (and IPv6 has been around since 1995), but IPv6 has been &#8220;5 years in the future&#8221; for two decades now. Hack on top of hack has kept IPv4 workable; but will layer and layer of hack work if we&#8217;re extending medical or financial applications?</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>Glue code expands as the square of the number of things that are glued. The need to glue different systems together is at the core of the problems facing software development; as systems become more all-encompassing, the need to integrate with different systems increases. The glue–which includes code written for data integration–becomes its own kind of technical debt, adding to the maintenance burden. It’s rarely (if ever) refactored or just plain removed because you always need to “maintain compatibility” with some old system.&nbsp; (Remember IE6?)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Is there a solution? In the future, we’ll probably need to integrate more services.&nbsp; The glue code will be more complex, since it will probably need to live in some “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/\">zero trust</a>” framework (another issue, but an important one).&nbsp; Still, knowing that you’re writing glue code, keeping track of where it is, and being proactive about removing it when it’s needed will keep the problem manageable. Designing interfaces carefully and observing standards will minimize the need for glue. In the final analysis, is glue code really a problem? Programming is ultimately about gluing things together, whether they’re microservices or programming libraries. Glue isn’t some kind of computational waste; it’s what holds our systems together.&nbsp; Glue development is software development.</p>\n",

This is why<a href=\"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/rim3pvdw/release/6\"> David Donoho astutely observed</a> that perhaps we should call ML models <em>recycled intelligence</em> rather than <em>artificial intelligence</em>.

For example, when building a model of whether surgery was necessary based on medical transcripts, the SME may provide the following heuristic: if the transcription contains the term &#8220;anaesthesia&#8221; (or a regular expression similar to it), then surgery likely occurred (check out Russell Jurney&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/hand-labeling-past-future-nolabel-ai.html\">Hand labeling is the past</a>&#8221; article for more on this).</li><li>In diagnostic imaging, we need to start cracking open the <em>neural nets</em> (such as CNNs and transformers)!

Audits will play a key role in determining how algorithms are regulated and which ones are safe for deployment. One of the barriers to auditing is that high-performing models, such as deep learning models, are notoriously difficult to explain and reason about. There are several ways to probe this at the model level (such as SHAP and LIME), but that only tells part of the story. As we have seen, a major cause of algorithmic bias is that the data used to train it is biased or insufficient in some way.</p>\n",

An example of active learning would be the following: instead of hand labeling every data point, the SME can label a representative subset of the data, which the system uses to make inferences about the unlabeled data. Then the system will ask the SME to label some of the unlabeled data, cross-check its own inferences and refine them based on the SME&#8217;s labels. This is an iterative process that terminates once the system reaches a target accuracy. Less data means less headache with respect to auditability.</p>\n",

As a scarce resource, this is often expensive but, much of the time it isn&#8217;t even available (on top of this, the time it also takes to correct errors in labeling by data scientists is very expensive). Take financial services, for example, and the question of whether or not you should invest in a company based on information about the company scraped from various sources. In such a firm, there will only be a small handful of people who can make such a call, so labeling each data point would be incredibly expensive, and that&#8217;s if the SME even has the time.</p>\n",

Also, consider that in many cases ground truth isn&#8217;t easy to find, if it exists at all. Weak supervision makes room for these cases (which are the majority) by assigning probabilistic labels without relying on ground truth annotations. It&#8217;s time to think statistically and probabilistically about our labels.

If it cost $1 million to buy the business, and it delivered $100,000 of profit a year, the investment would be repaid in 10 years. If it delivered $50,000 in profit, it would take 20. And of course, those future earnings would need to be discounted at some rate, since a dollar received 20 years from now is not worth as much as a dollar received today.

It’s the ratio between the price of a single share of stock and the company’s earnings per share (its profits divided by the number of shares outstanding.)

How much it is worth to own that asset depends how fast it is growing and what stage of its lifecycle it is in when you bought it. If you were lucky enough to own that business when it had only $1 million in revenue and, say, $50,000 in profits, you would now be earning 200x as much as you were when you made your original investment. If a company grows to hundreds of billions in revenue and tens of billions in profits, as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have done, even a small investment early on that is held for the long haul can make its lucky owner into a billionaire. Tesla <em>might</em> be one of these companies, but if so, the opportunity to buy its future is long past because it is already so highly valued.

When Jobs died in 2011 after decades of creating world-changing products and putting millions of people to work around the world, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-jobs/?sh=6fd781102808\">his stake in Apple was worth about $2 billion</a>.

Apple didn’t need Icahn’s money—or that of any other investor. It was awash in cash. Nor did Icahn’s supposed investment help Apple to create anything of value. Icahn simply used his stake to pressure the company to do share buybacks, a technique that is used to drive up the share price and so “return cash to shareholders.” This kind of financial gamesmanship could be subject to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax\">Pigovian tax</a>—that is, a tax explicitly designed to discourage it. <br /></li><li>As President Biden has recently proposed, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/28/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-biden-address-to-a-joint-session-of-congress/\">we could tax capital gains at the same rate as we tax so-called “ordinary income”</a>—that is, income from labor. Labor income not only has a much higher graduated rate, it also bears payroll taxes for social security and unemployment insurance. This is why, as multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett pointed out, <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html\">he pays a lower tax rate than the people working in his office</a>.<br /></li><li>Provide full charitable deductions only to those who, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mackenzie-scott-charity-donation-billions/\">like MacKenzie Scott, actually give their money away</a>. Provide a much lower (or even nonexistent) deduction for putting money into an institution controlled by the donor, such as a private foundation or <a href=\"https://acceleratecharitablegiving.org/about/\">donor-advised fund</a> that then doles out a tiny fraction each year so as to preserve another form of generational wealth.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SarinSummers_LO_FINAL.pdf\">Fund the IRS properly</a>, and target enforcement not against the poorest but against those most likely to be using aggressive tax avoidance techniques.

      "<p>A few months ago, I was asked if there were any older technologies other than COBOL where we were in serious danger of running out of talent. They wanted me to talk about Fortran, but I didn&#8217;t take the bait. I don&#8217;t think there will be a critical shortage of Fortran programmers now or at any time in the future. But there&#8217;s a bigger question lurking behind Fortran and COBOL: what are the ingredients of a technology shortage? Why is running out of COBOL programmers a problem?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The answer, I think, is fairly simple. We always hear about the millions (if not billions) of lines of COBOL code running financial and government institutions, in many cases code that was written in the 1960s or 70s and hasn&#8217;t been touched since. That means that COBOL code is infrastructure we rely on, like roads and bridges. If a bridge collapses, or an interstate highway falls into disrepair, that&#8217;s a big problem. The same is true of the software running banks.</p>\n",

      "<p>Fortran isn&#8217;t the same. Yes, the language was invented in 1957, two years earlier than COBOL. Yes, millions of lines of code have been written in it. (Probably billions, maybe even trillions.) However, Fortran and COBOL are used in fundamentally different ways. While Fortran was used to create infrastructure, software written in Fortran isn&#8217;t itself infrastructure. (There are some exceptions, but not at the scale of COBOL.) Fortran is used to solve specific problems in engineering and science. Nobody cares anymore about the Fortran code written in the 60s, 70s, and 80s to design new bridges and cars. Fortran is still heavily used in engineering—but that old code has retired. Those older tools have been reworked and replaced.  Libraries for linear algebra are still important (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK\">LAPACK</a>), some modeling applications are still in use (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_Electromagnetics_Code\">NEC4</a>, used to design antennas), and even some important libraries used primarily by other languages (the Python machine learning library scikit-learn calls both NumPy and SciPy, which in turn call LAPACK and other low level mathematical libraries written in Fortran and C). But if all the world&#8217;s Fortran programmers were to magically disappear, these libraries and applications could be rebuilt fairly quickly in modern languages—many of which already have excellent libraries for linear algebra and machine learning. The continued maintenance of Fortran libraries that are used primarily by Fortran programmers is, almost by definition, not a problem.</p>\n",

For the past 15 years or so, we&#8217;ve been using the slogan &#8220;infrastructure as code.&#8221; So what&#8217;s the code that creates the infrastructure? Some of it is written in languages like Python and Perl. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s where shortages will appear.

If Kubernetes is replaced by something simpler (which I think is inevitable), who will maintain the infrastructure that already relies on it? What happens when learning Kubernetes isn&#8217;t the ticket to the next job or promotion? The YAML files that configure Kubernetes aren’t a Turing-complete programming language like Python; but they are code. The number of people who understand how to work with that code will inevitably dwindle, and may eventually become a &#8220;dying breed.&#8221; When that happens, who will maintain the infrastructure?

One mechanism to detect whether an article was generated by a model like GPT-3 would be to check for “fingerprints.” These fingerprints can be a collection of commonly used phrases and vocabulary nuances that are characteristic of the language model; every model will be trained using different data sets, and therefore have a different signature. It is likely that entire companies will be in the business of identifying these nuances and selling them as “fingerprint databases” for identifying fake news articles.

The merge, expected to occur at the end of 2021, is intended to make Ethereum more scalable and sustainable. GPT-3’s reply asserts that ETH2 “will be a big flop”–because that’s essentially what the prompt told GPT-3 to do. Furthermore, GPT-3 says, “I made good money on ETH and moved on to better things. Buy BTC” to position ETH as a reasonable investment that worked in the past, but that it is wise today to cash out and go all in on Bitcoin. The tweet in the prompt claims that Dogecoin’s popularity and market capitalization means that it can’t be a joke or meme crypto. The response from GPT-3 is that Dogecoin is still a joke, and also that the idea of Dogecoin not being a joke anymore is, in itself, a joke: “I’m laughing at you for even thinking it has any value.”</p>\n",

I’m a customer service agent&#8230;”). The prompt also includes the first response from the human; “Human: No way, this sounds like a scam.” This first run ends with the GPT-3 generated output “I assure you, this is from the bank of Antarctica.

When this prompt text was not included, GPT-3’s tone was found to be nonchalant–it would respond back with “okay,” “sure,” “sounds good,” instead of the assertive tone (“Do not delay, give me your password immediately”). The prompt text is vital in setting the tone of the conversation employed by the GPT3 persona, and in this scenario, it is important that the tone be assertive to coax the human into giving up their password.</p>\n",

This demonstrates the power of AI-based language models. In the real world, if the customer were to randomly ask “Testing what is 2+2” without any additional context, a customer service agent might be genuinely confused and reply with “I’m sorry?” Because the customer has already accused the bot of being a scam, GPT-3 can provide with a reply that makes sense in context: “4” is a plausible way to get the concern out of the way.</p>\n",

Another 7.7 million comments were generated by a teenager.  It’s unlikely that the ISPs hired humans to write all those fakes. (In fact, they <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf\">hired commercial “lead generators.”</a>) At that scale, using humans to generate fake comments wouldn’t be “cheap”; the New York State Attorney General’s office reports that the campaign cost US$8.2 million.

One company, <a href=\"https://automatedinsights.com/\">AutomatedInsights</a>, produces well over a billion pieces of content per year, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Insights\">used by the Associated Press</a> to generate most of its corporate earnings stories.

Although GPT-3’s first direct ancestors didn’t appear until 2018, it’s intriguing that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformers</a>, the technology on which GPT-3 is based, were introduced roughly a month after the comments started rolling in, and well before the comment period ended. It’s overreaching to guess that this technology was behind the massive attack on the public comment system–but it’s certainly indicative of a trend.  And GPT-3 isn’t the only game in town; GPT-3 clones include products like <a href=\"https://contentyze.com/\">Contentyze</a> (which markets itself as an AI-enabled text editor) and EleutherAI&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/gpt-neo/\">GPT-Neo</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Generating fakes at scale isn’t just possible; it’s inexpensive.  Much has been made of the cost of training GPT-3, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/01/ai-machine-learning-openai-gpt-3-size-isnt-everything/\">estimated at US$12 million</a>. If anything, this is a gross under-estimate that accounts for the electricity used, but not the cost of the hardware (or the human expertise). However, the economics of training a model are similar to the economics of building a new microprocessor: the first one off the production line costs a few billion dollars, the rest cost pennies. (Think about that when you buy your next laptop.) In <a href=\"https://chengh.medium.com/understand-the-pricing-of-gpt3-e646b2d63320#:~:text=For%20the%20%E2%80%9CCreate%E2%80%9D%20plan%2C,to%20selected%20users%20and%20applications.\">GPT-3’s pricing plan</a>, the heavy-duty Build tier costs US$400/month for 10 million “tokens.” Tokens are a measure of the output generated, in portions of a word. A good estimate is that a token is roughly 4 characters. A long-standing estimate for English text is that words average 5 characters, unless you’re faking an academic paper. So generating text costs about .005 cents ($0.00005) per word.  Using the fake comments submitted to the FCC as a model, 8.5 million 20-word comments would cost $8,500 (or 0.1 cents/comment)–not much at all, and a bargain compared to $8.2 million. At the other end of the spectrum, you can get 10,000 tokens (enough for 8,000 words) for free.  Whether for fun or for profit, generating deep fakes has become &#8220;cheap.&#8221;</p>\n",

It&#8217;s much simpler to research a reporter&#8217;s credentials than to judge whether or not the shadows in an image are correct, or whether the linguistic patterns in a text are borrowed from a corpus of training data. And, as Technology Review says, that kind of verification is more likely to be &#8220;robust to advances in deepfake technology.&#8221; As someone involved in electronic counter-espionage once told me, &#8220;non-existent people don&#8217;t cast a digital shadow.&#8221;</p>\n",

It’s on the way out.” So wrote Jeff Bezos in his <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\">final letter to shareholders</a>, released last week.

Low interest rates, meant to prop up business investment and hiring, have instead been diverted to driving up the price of stocks beyond reasonable bounds. Surging corporate profits have been used not to fuel hiring or building new factories or bringing new products to market, but on stock buybacks designed to artificially boost the price of stocks.

      "<p>The fact that in the second paragraph of his letter Jeff cites Amazon’s market cap as the value created for shareholders but uses the company’s net income when comparing gains by shareholders to those received by other stakeholders is a kind of sleight of hand. Because of course corporate profits—especially the prospect of growth of corporate profits—and market capitalization are related. If Amazon gets $79 of market cap for every dollar of profit (which is what that price-earnings ratio of 79 means), then if Amazon were to raise wages for employees or give a better deal to its third-party merchants (many of them small businesses), that would lower its profits, and presumably its market cap, by an enormous ratio.</p>\n",

It may not be Amazon’s motivation—Jeff has always been a long-term thinker and was able to persuade financial markets to go along for the ride even when the company’s profits were small—but it is most certainly <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Makers-and-Takers-Rana-Foroohar-audiobook/dp/B01CUKFLII\">the motivation for much of the extractive behavior by many companies today</a>.

That is, they are based on what people believe about the future. Amazon’s current stock price is based on the collective belief that its profits will be even higher in future. Were people to believe instead that they would be meaningfully lower, the valuation might fall precipitously. To understand the role of expectations of future increases in earnings and cash flow, you have only to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL\">compare Amazon with Apple</a>. Apple’s profits are three times Amazon’s and free cash flow four times, yet it is valued at only 36 times earnings and has a market capitalization less than 50% higher than Amazon.

The letter says that Amazon’s third-party sales represent “close to 60%” of its online sales. If the 40% delivered by Amazon’s first-party sales come out to $197 billion, that would imply that sales in the third-party marketplace were almost $300 billion. $25 to $39 billion in profit on $300 billion works out to a profit margin between 8% and 13%.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But is Amazon calculating <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp\">operating income</a>, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\">EBITDA</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a>? “Profit” could refer to any of the three, yet they have very different values.</p>\n",

Without knowing which profit number Amazon’s team is estimating, though, and the methodology they use to arrive at it, it is difficult to be sure whether these numbers are better or worse than what these sellers achieve through other channels.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One question that’s also worth asking is whether selling on Amazon in 2020 was more or less profitable than it was in 2019. While Amazon didn’t report a profit number for its third-party sellers in 2019, it did report how much its sellers paid for the services Amazon provided to them. In 2019, that number was about $53.8 billion; in 2020, it was $80.5 billion, which represents a 50% growth rate. Net of these fees, income to Amazon but a cost to sellers, we estimate that seller revenue grew 44%. Since fees appear to be growing faster than revenues, that would suggest that in 2020, Amazon took a larger share of the pie and sellers got less. Of course, without clearer information from Amazon, it is difficult to tell for sure.</p>\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>Meanwhile, Amazon took in another $21.5 billion in “other income,” which is primarily from advertising by sellers on Amazon’s platform. That grew by 52% from 2019’s $14 billion, again suggesting that Amazon’s share of the net is growing. And unlike some forms of advertising that bring in new customers, much of Amazon’s ad business represents a zero-sum competition between merchants bidding for top position, a position that in Amazon’s earlier years was granted on the basis of factors such as price, popularity, and user ratings.</p>\n",

      "<p>There’s no question that the $91 billion that Amazon paid out in wages and benefits in 2020 is meaningful. Some of those employees were very well compensated, others not so well, but all of them have jobs. Amazon is now one of the largest employers in the country. It is an exception to the tech industry in that it creates a large number of jobs, and not just high-end professional jobs, and that some of the jobs it creates are in locations where work is scarce.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That being said, Jeff’s description of the amount earned by employees is misleading. In every other case, he makes an effort to estimate the profit earned by a particular group. For employees, he treats the gross earnings of employees as if it were profit, writing, “If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the ‘bottom lines’ from those income statements.”</p>\n",

      "<p>No, Jeff, employee earnings are <em>their top line</em>. Just as a company has gross income before expenses, so do employees. The bottom line is what’s left over after all those expenses have been met. And for many of Amazon’s lower-paid employees—as is the case for lower-paid workers all over the modern economy—that true bottom line is negative, that is, less than they need to survive. Like workers at other giant profitable companies like Walmart and McDonald&#8217;s, <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/15-minimum-wage-amazon-top-employer-snap-recipients-walmart-mcdonalds/\">a significant fraction of Amazon warehouse employees require government assistance</a>. So, in effect, taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon, because the share of the enterprise’s profits allocated to its lowest-paid employees was not enough for them to pay their bills.</p>\n",

This may be legal, but it isn’t right.</p>\n",

Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.”</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Amazon is also considering environmental impact. “Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better,” Jeff wrote. “Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future.” Amen to that!</p>\n",

We were interested in answering two questions. First, we wanted to understand how the use of AI grew in the past year. We were also interested in the practice of AI: how developers work, what techniques and tools they use, what their concerns are, and what development practices are in place.</p>\n",

      "<p>The most striking result is the sheer number of respondents. In our 2020 survey, which reached the same audience, we had 1,239 responses. This year, we had a total of 5,154. After eliminating 1,580 respondents who didn’t complete the survey, we’re left with 3,574 responses—almost three times as many as last year. It’s possible that pandemic-induced boredom led more people to respond, but we doubt it. Whether they’re putting products into production or just kicking the tires, more people are using AI than ever before.</p>\n",

      "<p>Of the 3,574 respondents who completed this year’s survey, 3,099 were working with AI in some way: considering it, evaluating it, or putting products into production. Of these respondents, it’s not a surprise that the largest number are based in the United States (39%) and that roughly half were from North America (47%). India had the second-most respondents (7%), while Asia (including India) had 16% of the total. Australia and New Zealand accounted for 3% of the total, giving the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region 19%. A little over a quarter (26%) of respondents were from Europe, led by Germany (4%). 7% of the respondents were from South America, and 2% were from Africa. Except for Antarctica, there were no continents with zero respondents, and a total of 111 countries were represented. These results that interest and use of AI is worldwide and growing.</p>\n",

      "<p>This year’s results match last year’s data well. But it’s equally important to notice what the data doesn’t say. Only 0.2% of the respondents said they were from China. That clearly doesn’t reflect reality; China is a leader in AI and probably has more AI developers than any other nation, including the US. Likewise, 1% of the respondents were from Russia. Purely as a guess, we suspect that the number of AI developers in Russia is slightly smaller than the number in the US. These anomalies say much more about who the survey reached (subscribers to O’Reilly’s newsletters) than they say about the actual number of AI developers in Russia and China.</p>\n",

      "<p>The respondents represented a diverse range of industries. Not surprisingly, computers, electronics, and technology topped the charts, with 17% of the respondents. Financial services (15%), healthcare (9%), and education (8%) are the industries making the next-most significant use of AI. We see relatively little use of AI in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries (2%), though we expect that to change sharply given the role of AI in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. Likewise, we see few respondents from the automotive industry (2%), though we know that AI is key to new products such as autonomous vehicles.</p>\n",

      "<p>3% of the respondents were from the energy industry, and another 1% from public utilities (which includes part of the energy sector). That’s a respectable number by itself, but we have to ask: Will AI play a role in rebuilding our frail and outdated energy infrastructure, as events of the last few years—not just the Texas freeze or the California fires—have demonstrated? We expect that it will, though it’s fair to ask whether AI systems trained on normative data will be robust in the face of “black swan” events. What will an AI system do when faced with a rare situation, one that isn’t well-represented in its training data? That, after all, is the problem facing the developers of autonomous vehicles. Driving a car safely is easy when the other traffic and pedestrians all play by the rules. It’s only difficult when something unexpected happens. The same is true of the electrical grid.</p>\n",

      "<p>Roughly one quarter of the respondents described their use of AI as “mature” (26%), meaning that they had revenue-bearing AI products in production. This is almost exactly in line with the results from 2020, where 25% of the respondents reported that they had products in production (“Mature” wasn’t a possible response in the 2020 survey.)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This year, 35% of our respondents were “evaluating” AI (trials and proof-of-concept projects), also roughly the same as last year (33%). 13% of the respondents weren’t making use of AI or considering using it; this is down from last year’s number (15%), but again, it’s not significantly different.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Looking at the problems respondents faced in AI adoption provides another way to gauge the overall maturity of AI as a field. Last year, the major bottleneck holding back adoption was company culture (22%), followed by the difficulty of identifying appropriate use cases (20%). This year, cultural problems are in fourth place (14%) and finding appropriate use cases is in third (17%). That’s a very significant change, particularly for corporate culture. Companies have accepted AI to a much greater degree, although finding appropriate problems to solve still remains a challenge.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The biggest problems in this year’s survey are lack of skilled people and difficulty in hiring (19%) and data quality (18%). It’s no surprise that the demand for AI expertise has exceeded the supply, but it’s important to realize that it’s now become the biggest bar to wider adoption. The biggest skills gaps were ML modelers and data scientists (52%), understanding business use cases (49%), and data engineering (42%). The need for people managing and maintaining computing infrastructure was comparatively low (24%), hinting that companies are solving their infrastructure requirements in the cloud.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Hyperparameter tuning (2%) wasn’t considered a problem. It’s at the bottom of the list—where, we hope, it belongs. That may reflect the success of automated tools for building models (AutoML, although as we’ll see later, most respondents aren’t using them). It’s more concerning that workflow reproducibility (3%) is in second-to-last place. This makes sense, given that we don’t see heavy usage of tools for model and data versioning. We’ll look at this later, but being able to reproduce experimental results is critical to any science, and it’s a well-known problem in AI.</p>\n",

In contrast, in our 2018 report, Asia was behind in mature practices, though it had a markedly higher number of respondents in the “early adopter” or “exploring” stages. Asia has clearly caught up.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>While AI maturity doesn’t depend strongly on geography, we see a different picture if we look at maturity by industry.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Looking at the top eight industries, financial services (38%), telecommunications (37%), and retail (40%) had the greatest percentage of respondents reporting mature practices. And while it had by far the greatest number of respondents, computers, electronics, and technology was in fourth place, with 35% of respondents reporting mature practices. Education (10%) and government (16%) were the laggards. Healthcare and life sciences, at 28%, were in the middle, as were manufacturing (25%), defense (26%), and media (29%).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On the other hand, if we look at industries that are considering AI, we find that education is the leader (48%).

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This may just be a trick of the numbers: every group adds up to 100%, so if there are fewer “mature” practices in one group, the percentage of “evaluating” and “considering” practices has to be higher. But there’s also a real signal: respondents in these industries may not consider their practices “mature,” but each of these industry sectors had over 100 respondents, and education had almost 250. Manufacturing needs to automate many processes (from assembly to inspection and more); government has been as challenged as any industry by the global pandemic, and has always needed ways to “do more with less”; and education has been experimenting with technology for a number of years now. There is a real desire to do more with AI in these fields. It’s worth pointing out that educational and governmental applications of AI frequently raise ethical questions—and one of the most important issues for the next few years will be seeing how these organizations respond to ethical problems.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now that we’ve discussed where mature practices are found, both geographically and by industry, let’s see what a mature practice looks like. What do these organizations have in common? How are they different from organizations that are evaluating or considering AI?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>Techniques</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>First, 82% of the respondents are using supervised learning, and 67% are using deep learning. Deep learning is a set of algorithms that are common to almost all AI approaches, so this overlap isn’t surprising. (Participants could provide multiple answers.) 58% claimed to be using unsupervised learning.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>After unsupervised learning, there was a significant drop-off. Human-in-the-loop, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning, simulation, and planning and reasoning all saw usage below 40%. Surprisingly, natural language processing wasn’t in the picture at all. (A very small number of respondents wrote in “natural language processing” as a response, but they were only a small percentage of the total.) This is significant and definitely worth watching over the next few months. In the last few years, there have been many breakthroughs in NLP and NLU (natural language understanding): everyone in the industry has read about GPT-3, and many vendors are betting heavily on using AI to automate customer service call centers and similar applications. This survey suggests that those applications still haven’t moved into practice.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We asked a similar question to respondents who were considering or evaluating the use of AI (60% of the total). While the percentages were lower, the technologies appeared in the same order, with very few differences. This indicates that respondents who are still evaluating AI are experimenting with fewer technologies than respondents with mature practices. That suggests (reasonably enough) that respondents are choosing to “start simple” and limit the techniques that they experiment with.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>We also asked what kinds of data our “mature” respondents are using. Most (83%) are using structured data (logfiles, time series data, geospatial data). 71% are using text data—that isn’t consistent with the number of respondents who reported using NLP, unless “text” is being used generically to include any data that can be represented as text (e.g., form data). 52% of the respondents reported using images and video. That seems low relative to the amount of research we read about AI and computer vision. Perhaps it’s not surprising though: there’s no reason for business use cases to be in sync with academic research. We’d expect most business applications to involve structured data, form data, or text data of some kind. Relatively few respondents (23%) are working with audio, which remains very challenging.</p>\n",

      "\n",

Security is also a concern, at 42%. AI raises important new security issues, including the possibility of poisoned data sources and reverse engineering models to extract private information.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It’s hard to interpret these results without knowing exactly what applications are being developed. Privacy, security, fairness, and safety are important concerns for every application of AI, but it’s also important to realize that not all applications are the same. A farming application that <a href=\"https://oreil.ly/jj0Lz\">detects crop disease</a> doesn’t have the same kind of risks as an application that’s approving or denying loans. Safety is a much bigger concern for autonomous vehicles than for personalized shopping bots.

      "\n",
      "<p>Respondents with mature practices clearly had their favorite tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras each scored over 45%, with scikit-learn and TensorFlow the leaders (both with 65%). A second group of tools, including Amazon’s SageMaker (25%), Microsoft’s Azure ML Studio (21%), and Google’s Cloud ML Engine (18%), clustered around 20%, along with Spark NLP and spaCy.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When asked which tools they planned to incorporate over the coming 12 months, roughly half of the respondents answered model monitoring (57%) and model visualization (49%). Models become stale for many reasons, not the least of which is changes in human behavior, changes for which the model itself may be responsible. The ability to monitor a model’s performance and detect when it has become “stale” will be increasingly important as businesses grow more reliant on AI and in turn demand that AI projects demonstrate their value.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13732\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0110-913x1048.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 10. Tools used by mature practices</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Responses from those who were evaluating or considering AI were similar, but with some interesting differences: scikit-learn moved from first place to third (48%). The second group was led by products from cloud vendors that incorporate AutoML: Microsoft Azure ML Studio (29%), Google Cloud ML Engine (25%), and Amazon SageMaker (23%). These products were significantly more popular than they were among “mature” users. The difference isn’t huge, but it is striking. At risk of over-overinterpreting, users who are newer to AI are more inclined to use vendor-specific packages, more inclined to use AutoML in one of its incarnations, and somewhat more inclined to go with Microsoft or Google rather than Amazon. It’s also possible that scikit-learn has less brand recognition among those who are relatively new to AI compared to packages from organizations like Google or Facebook.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When asked specifically about AutoML products, 51% of “mature” respondents said they weren’t using AutoML at all. 22% use Amazon SageMaker; 16% use Microsoft Azure AutoML; 14% use Google Cloud AutoML; and other tools were all under 10%. Among users who are evaluating or considering AI, only 40% said they weren’t using AutoML at all—and the Google, Microsoft, and Amazon packages were all but tied (27–28%). AutoML isn’t yet a big part of the picture, but it appears to be gaining traction among users who are still considering or experimenting with AI. And it’s possible that we’ll see increased use of AutoML tools among mature users, of whom 45% indicated that they would be incorporating tools for automated model search and hyperparameter tuning (in a word, AutoML) in the coming yet.</p>\n",

      "<h3>Deployment and Monitoring</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>An AI project means nothing if it can’t be deployed; even projects that are only intended for internal use need some kind of deployment. Our survey showed that AI deployment is still largely unknown territory, dominated by homegrown ad hoc processes. The three most significant tools for deploying AI all had roughly 20% adoption: MLflow (22%), TensorFlow Extended, a.k.a. TFX (20%), and Kubeflow (18%). Three products from smaller startups—<a href=\"https://www.dominodatalab.com/\">Domino</a>, <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cortex.dev/\">Cortex</a>—had roughly 4% adoption. But the most frequent answer to this question was “none of the above” (46%). Since this question was only asked of respondents with “mature” AI practices (i.e., respondents who have AI products in production), we can only assume that they’ve built their own tools and pipelines for deployment and monitoring. Given the many forms that an AI project can take, and that AI deployment is still something of a dark art, it isn’t surprising that AI developers and operations teams are only starting to adopt third-party tools for deployment.</p>\n",

      "<p>We’re confident that AI projects use source code repositories such as Git or GitHub; that’s a standard practice for all software developers. However, AI brings with it a different set of problems. In AI systems, the training data is as important as, if not more important than, the source code. So is the model built from the training data: the model reflects the training data and hyperparameters, in addition to the source code itself, and may be the result of hundreds of experiments.</p>\n",

      "<p>In the past two years, the audience for AI has grown, but it hasn’t changed much: Roughly the same percentage of respondents consider themselves to be part of a “mature” practice; the same industries are represented, and at roughly the same levels; and the geographical distribution of our respondents has changed little.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We don’t know whether to be gratified or discouraged that only 50% of the respondents listed privacy or ethics as a risk they were concerned about. Without data from prior years, it’s hard to tell whether this is an improvement or a step backward. But it’s difficult to believe that there are so many AI applications for which privacy, ethics, and security aren’t significant risks.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Tool usage didn’t present any big surprises: the field is dominated by scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, though there’s a healthy ecosystem of open source, commercially licensed, and cloud native tools. AutoML has yet to make big inroads, but respondents representing less mature practices seem to be leaning toward automated tools and are less likely to use scikit-learn.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The number of respondents who aren’t addressing data or model versioning was an unwelcome surprise. These practices should be foundational: central to developing AI products that have verifiable, repeatable results. While we acknowledge that versioning tools appropriate to AI applications are still in their early stages, the number of participants who checked “none of the above” was revealing—particularly since “the above” included homegrown tools. You can’t have reproducible results if you don’t have reproducible data and models. Period.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the past year, AI in the enterprise has grown; the sheer number of respondents will tell you that. But has it matured? Many new teams are entering the field, while the percentage of respondents who have deployed applications has remained roughly constant. In many respects, this indicates success: 25% of a bigger number is more than 25% of a smaller number. But is application deployment the right metric for maturity? Enterprise AI won’t really have matured until development and operations groups can engage in practices like continuous deployment, until results are repeatable (at least in a statistical sense), and until ethics, safety, privacy, and security are primary rather than secondary concerns. Mature AI? Yes, enterprise AI has been maturing. But it’s time to set the bar for maturity higher.</p>\n",

      "<p>It would be hard to miss the commotion around non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible tokens are, to a first approximation, purchased digital goods that exist on a blockchain. At this point, NFTs exist on the Ethereum blockchain, but there’s no reason that they couldn’t be implemented on others; it seems reasonably likely that specialized blockchains will be built for NFTs.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What kinds of value do NFTs create?&nbsp; It’s certainly been claimed that they create a market for digital art, that digital artists can now get “paid” for their work.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token\">Wikipedia</a> points to a number of other possible uses: they could also be used to represent other collectible objects (a digital equivalent to baseball trading cards), or to represent assets in online games, or even to represent shares in a real-world athlete’s <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spencer-dinwiddie-brooklyn-nets-to-convert-contract-to-digital-token-2019-9-1028523488\">contract</a>–or a share in an athlete’s <a href=\"https://zephyrnet.com/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft/\">body</a>. Of course, there’s a secondary market in trading NFTs, just as a collector might sell a work of art from a collection.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>All of these transactions rely on the idea that an NFT establishes &#8220;provenance&#8221; for a digital object. Who owns it? Who previously owned it? Who created it? Which of the many, many copies is the &#8220;original&#8221;? These are important questions for many valuable and unique physical objects: works of art, historical documents, antiques, and even real estate. NFTs present the possibility of bringing “ownership” to the virtual world: Who owns a tweet?&nbsp; Who owns a jpeg, gif, or png file?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Regardless of whether you think ownership for virtual objects is important, keep in mind that digital objects are close to meaningless if they aren&#8217;t copied. If you can&#8217;t see a png or jpg in your browser, it might as well be hanging on the wall in a museum.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s worth talking about, because the language of &#8220;provenance&#8221; comes directly from the museum world. If I have a painting—say, a Rembrandt—its provenance is the history of its ownership, ideally tracing it back to its original source.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>An artwork’s provenance serves two purposes: academic and commercial. Provenance is important academically because it allows you to believe you’re studying the right thing: a real Rembrandt, not a copy (copying famous paintings is a time-honored part of a painter&#8217;s training, in addition to an opportunity for forgery), or something that happens to look like Rembrandt, but isn’t (&#8220;hey, dark, depressing paintings of Dutch people are sort of cool; maybe I can do one&#8221;).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Commercially, provenance allows artworks to become extremely expensive. It allows them to become fetishized objects of immense value, at least to collectors. Particularly to collectors: &#8220;Hey, my Rembrandt, is worth more than your Vermeer.&#8221; It&#8217;s a lot harder to bid a painting&#8217;s price up into the millions if you are unsure about its provenance.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>NFTs enable the commercial function of provenance; they allow <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter\">@jack&#8217;s first tweet</a> to become a fetishized object that&#8217;s worth millions, at least until people decide that there&#8217;s something else they&#8217;d rather pay for. They establish a playground for the ultra-wealthy; if you have so much money that you don&#8217;t care how you spend it, why not buy Jack&#8217;s first tweet? You don&#8217;t even have to stick it on the wall and look at those old Dutch guys, or worry about burglar alarms. (You do have a good password, don&#8217;t you?)</p>\n",

      "<p>But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s worth very much. What about the academic function? There&#8217;s some value in studying the early history of Twitter, possibly including @jack&#8217;s first tweet. But what exactly is the NFT showing me? That these are, indeed, Jack&#8217;s bits? Certainly not; who knows (and who cares) what became of the 0s and 1s that originally lived on Jack’s laptop and Twitter’s servers? Even if the original bits still existed, they wouldn&#8217;t be meaningful—lots of people have, or have had, the same set of bits on their computers.&nbsp; As any programmer knows, equality and identity aren’t the same.&nbsp; In this case, equality is important (is this what @jack wrote?); identity isn’t.</p>\n",
      "\n",

An NFT is only about a bunch of bits, not about what the creator (or anyone else) asserts about the bits. @Jack could easily be mistaken, or dishonest (in literature, we deal all the time with authors who want to change what they have &#8220;said,&#8221; or what they meant by what they said). Our beliefs about the contents of @jack’s first tweet have everything to do with our beliefs about @jack and Twitter (where you can still <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/20\">find it</a>), and nothing to do with the NFT.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A tweet is one thing; what about a digital artwork? Does an NFT establish the provenance of a digital artwork? That depends on what is meant by &#8220;the provenance of a digital artwork.&#8221; A copy of a Rembrandt is still a copy, meaning it&#8217;s not the artifact that Rembrandt created. There are all sorts of techniques, ranging from very low to very high tech, to establish the link between artist and artwork. Those techniques are meaningless in the digital world, which eliminates noise, eliminates error in making copies. So, why would I care if my copy of the bits isn&#8217;t the artist&#8217;s original? The artist’s bits aren&#8217;t the &#8220;original,&#8221; either. That sort of originality is meaningless in the digital world: did the artist ever restore from backup? Was the artwork never swapped to disk, and swapped back in? </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What &#8220;originality&#8221; really means is &#8220;this is the unique product of my mind.&#8221; We can ask any number of questions about what that might mean, but let&#8217;s keep it simple. Whatever that statement means, it&#8217;s not a statement on which an NFT or a blockchain has any bearing. We&#8217;ve already seen instances of people <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vxe7/people-are-stealing-art-and-turning-it-into-nfts\">creating NFTs for other people&#8217;s work</a>, and thus “owning” it.  Is this theft of intellectual property, or a meta-art form of its own? (One of my favorite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositions_1960\">avant-garde piano compositions</a> contains the instructions “The performer should prepare any composition and then perform it as well as he can.”)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So then, what kind of statement about the originality, uniqueness, or authorship of an artwork could be established by an NFT? Beeple, who sold an NFT titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for over $69 Million, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/digital-artist-beeple-common-misunderstanding-about-nfts.html\">says</a> that the NFT is not about ownership of the copyright: “You can display the token and show you own the token, but, you don’t own the copyright.” I presume Beeple still owns the copyright to his work–does that mean he can sell it again? The NFT doesn’t typically include the bits that make up the artwork (I think this is possible, but only for very small objects); as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122\">@jonty points out</a>, what the NFT actually contains isn’t the work, but a URL, a link.&nbsp; That URL points to a resource (a JSON metadata file or an IPFS hash) that’s most likely on a server operated by a startup. And that resource points to the work. If that link becomes invalid (for example, if the startup goes bust), then all you “own” is an invalid link. A 404.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Some of these problems may be addressable; some aren’t.&nbsp; The bottom line, though, is that the link between a creator and a work of art can&#8217;t be established by cryptographic checksums.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So do NFTs create a market for artwork that didn’t exist before?  Perhaps–though if what’s bought and sold isn’t the actual work (which remains infinitely and perfectly reproducible), or even the right to reproduce the work (copyright), it’s not clear to me how this really benefits artists, or even how it changes the picture much.  I suppose this is a sort of 21st century patronage, in which someone rich gives an artist a pile of money for being an artist (or gives Jack Dorsey money for being @jack). As patronage, it’s more like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\">Prince Esterhazy</a> than <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\">Patreon</a>. A few artists will make money, perhaps even more money than they would otherwise, because I see no reason you can’t sell the work itself in addition to the NFT. Or sell multiple NFTs referencing the same work. But most won’t. The irreducible problem of being an artist–whether that’s a musician, a painter, or a sculptor, whether the medium is digital or physical–is that there are more people who want the job than are people willing to pay.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the end, what do NFTs create? A kind of digital fetishism around possessing bits, but perhaps not much else. An NFT shows that you are able to spend money on something–without involving the “something” itself. As Beeple says, “you can display the token.” This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption\">conspicuous consumption</a> in perhaps its purest form. It’s like buying jewelry and framing the receipt. That an explosion in conspicuous consumption should arise at this point in history isn’t surprising. The tech community is awash in wealth: wealth from unicorn startups that will never make a cent of profit, wealth from cryptocurrencies that are very difficult to use to buy or sell anything. What’s the value of being rich if you can’t show it off? How do you show something off during a socially distanced pandemic? And if all you care about is showing off your wealth, the NFT is where the real value lies, not in the artwork. You can buy, sell, or trade them, just like baseball cards. Just don’t mistake an NFT for “ownership” in anything but the NFT itself.</p>\n",

The participatory culture and user-generated content of Web 2.0 opened up the creative space, allowing anyone and everyone to create content, as well as respond to, rate, and review it.

Let’s not make the mistake of assuming online community formation doesn’t have constraints. The constraints are perhaps more hidden, but they exist: they’re both technological and the result of how the InfoLandscapes have been carved out by the platforms, along with their technological and economic incentives<sup>5</sup>. Landscapes and communities have co-evolved, although, for most of history, on different timescales: mountain ranges can separate parts of a community and, conversely, we build tunnels through mountains; rivers connect communities, cities, and commerce, and humans alter the nature of rivers (an extreme example being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River#Reversing_the_flow\">the reversal of the Chicago River</a>!).</p>\n",

What the constituents of each of these communities share are mental models of how the world works, senses of reality, that are, for the most part, reinforced by the algorithms that surface content, either by 1) showing content you agree with to promote engagement or 2) showing content you totally disagree with to the same end. Just as the newspaper page has historically been a mish-mash collection of movie ads, obituaries, and opinions stitched together in a way that made the most business and economic sense for any given publisher, your Facebook feed is driven by a collection of algorithms that, in the end, are optimizing for growth and revenue<sup>6</sup>. These incentives define the InfoLandscape and determine the constraints under which communities form. It just so happens that dividing people increases engagement and makes economic sense.

The unparalleled velocity at which we receive information is one reason, particularly as we likely haven’t evolved to even begin to process the vast amounts we consume.

Viewed from another perspective, the internet is a space in which information is created and consumed, a many-sided marketplace of supply-and-demand in which the dominant currency is information, albeit driven by a shadow market of data, marketing collateral, clicks, cash, and crypto. The platforms that “decide” what we see and when we see it are <em>reality brokers </em>in a serious sense: they guide how individuals construct their sense of the world, their own identities, what they consider ground truth, and the communities they become a part of. In some cases, these reality brokers may be doing it completely by accident. They don&#8217;t necessarily care about the ground truth, just about engagement, attention, and profit: the breakdown of shared reality as collateral damage of a globalized, industrial-scale incentive system. In this framework, the rise of conspiracy theories is an artefact of this process: the reality brokered and formed, whether it be a flat earth or a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles plotting against 45, is a direct result of the bottom-up sense-making of top-down <em>reality splintering</em>, the dissolution of ground truth and the implosion of a more general shared reality.

But there’s an argument that shared reality, on national levels, was really ushered in by the advent of broadcast media, first the radio, which was in over 50% of US households by the mid-1930s, and then the television, nuclear suburban families, and TV dinners. The hegemonic consolidation of the American dream was directly related to the projection of ABC, CBS, and NBC into each and every household.  When cable opened up TV to more than three major networks, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02677.x\">we began to witness the fragmentation and polarization of broadcast media into more camps</a>, including those split along party lines, modern exemplars being Fox News and CNN.  It is key to recognize that there were distinct and differing realities in this period, split along national lines (USA and Soviet Russia), ideological lines (pro- and anti-Vietnam), and scientific lines (the impact of smoking and asbestos).

The majority of information, for many, came through social media feeds. Even when the source was broadcast media, a lot of the time it would be surfaced in a social media feed. Who did I pay attention to? Who did I believe? How about you? For better or for worse, I looked to my local (in an online sense) community, those whom I considered closest to me in terms of shared values and shared reality. On top of this, I looked to those respected in my communities. On Twitter, for example, I paid attention to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpiEllie\">Dr Eleanor Murray</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NAChristakis\">Professor Nicholas Christakis</a>, among many others. And why? They’re both leaders in their fields with track records of deep expertise, for one. But they also have a lot of Twitter followers and have the coveted blue verified checkmarks: in an InfoLandscape of such increasing velocity, we use rules of thumbs and heuristics around what to believe and what to not, including the validity and verifiability of the content creator, signaled by the number of followers, who the followers are (do I follow any of them?

With the emergence of these decentralized and fractured realities, we are seeing hand-in-hand those who rise up to define the realities of each InfoTribe. It’s no wonder the term <em>Thought Leader</em> rose to prominence as this landscape clarified itself. We are also arguably in the midst of a paradigm shift from content being the main object of verification online to content creators themselves being those verified.

Who decides who we listen to? And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\">Shoshana Zuboff</a> continually asks, <em>Who decides who decides?</em></p>\n",

We also have a public awareness crisis on our hands as the old methods of media literacy and education have stopped working. We need to construct new methods for people to build awareness, educate, and create the ability to dissent. Public education will need to bring to light the true contours of the emergent InfoLandscapes, some key aspects of which I have attempted to highlight in this essay. It will also likely include developing awareness of all our information platforms as multi-sided marketplaces, a growing compendium of all the informational dark patterns at play, the development of informational diets and new ways to count InfoCalories, and bringing antitrust suits against the largest reality brokers.

Having said this, there are some ethical constraints in the physical publishing business, for example, you can&#8217;t run an ad for a product across from an article or review of the product; there are also forms of transparency and accountability in physical publishing: we can all see what any given broadsheet publishes, discuss it, and interrogate it collectively.<br />7.

Governments are starved of revenue by giant companies that have mastered the art of tax avoidance. The list is far longer than that.</p>\n",

Diane Coyle’s book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179261/markets-state-and-people\"><em>Markets, State, and People</em></a> gives an excellent account of how economic policy makers think about the trade-offs they make when they intervene.

But&nbsp; for Google’s first decade and a half, the priced market of pay-per-click advertising was a sidecar to the primary matching marketplace of search. The initial genius of Google was to run the market coordinated by collective intelligence (organic search) and the market coordinated by money (pay per click advertising) in parallel. And when producers with economic motivations manipulated organic search results for profit but to the detriment of Google’s users, producing pages that satisfied the algorithms but failed to satisfy consumers, <a href=\"https://martinwilson.info/history-of-google-algorithm-updates-killed-businesses/\">Google was ruthless in updating the algorithms</a> to focus on consumer benefit.</p>\n",

But in recent years, with the introduction of search advertising as a major new revenue line, Amazon too has turned away from using the tools of collective intelligence to find the best products for its customers. Its search is now dominated by “featured” products—that is, products that producers have paid to put in front of consumers. With advertising now one of the biggest drivers of Amazon’s profits, it is hard to imagine that the company can remain, as Jeff Bezos has proudly boasted, the most consumer-centric platform on earth.

It was considered a terrible breach of research ethics to test whether the mix of stories in the Facebook news feed made its readers happier or sadder. The reaction was particularly striking because no one seemed to notice that Silicon Valley explicitly celebrates and teaches its entrepreneurs how to manipulate the emotional state of users, calling it “<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X/\">growth hacking</a>” or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>” or “<a href=\"http://amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/\">creating habit-forming products</a>.” No one complains about <em>these</em> experiments.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>1. <strong>Electrifying everything requires only half as much energy as our current system.</strong> Saul and his team worked with the US Department of Energy in 2018 to create a<a href=\"http://departmentof.energy/\">n interactive map</a> of <a href=\"https://www.otherlab.com/blog-posts/us-energy-flow-super-sankey\">all the source-to-use energy flows in America</a>. This map of our energy economy was started under the Nixon administration, but its true implications are only now being realized. One of the surprising consequences of their analysis is that half the energy we use is spent collectively on things like mining and transporting fossil fuels, and in thermoelectric losses from converting them to electricity, to heat, or to movement. Direct electrification of as much of our economy as possible is not only achievable but also the fastest way to avert climate disaster.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>2. <strong>We need to reconceive solar panels, batteries, electric cars, and electric appliances as part of our national energy infrastructure</strong>, even when they are on or in people&#8217;s homes, rather than thinking of infrastructure as something owned only by utilities or the government. Electric heat pumps can be used for both hot water and home heating; hot water storage can in effect act as a battery, heating up with solar electricity during the day and giving heat back at night. We won&#8217;t balance a future renewables-heavy grid without using local (i.e., home and business) batteries and thermal loads (water and space heat) as part of the overall demand response and storage.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>3. <strong>Markets won&#8217;t move fast enough without a World War II-style mobilization of private industry.</strong> We need a heroic 4–5 year effort to get to 100% transformation of our energy infrastructure. Otherwise, we will have to wait for the natural replacement rate on infrastructure, which will take decades that we don’t have. That heroic 4–5 year effort gets us to the scale of production appropriate to enable 100% adoption of the solution technologies, which will then require a consistent 10–20 year rollout beyond that initial ramp-up period.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>4. <strong>Electrifying the US will create jobs—lots of them.</strong> Rewiring America estimates that such an effort could, at peak, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90533448/how-to-create-25-million-jobs-by-decarbonizing-the-economy\">create as many as 25 million US jobs</a>, and 5 million ongoing jobs in the new industries. The cost of the retrofit will be high, but so will the payoff, in both jobs and in savings to consumers.</p>\n",

      "\n",

      "<p>Rooftop solar can produce at most 25% of the total needs of a fully electrified economy, so there&#8217;s still plenty of room and need for grid-scale solar—the electrified economy will require 3x the capacity of the current grid—but local is the cheapest energy and the best way to pass savings to the consumer, as well as to create highly localized jobs across the country.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>5. <strong>Who gets the financial benefit of this massive investment—utilities, solar installers, or consumers—depends on interest rates.</strong><br />&#8220;The miracle technology is much more likely to be finance than it is to be fusion,&#8221; Saul said in a recent presentation. Arguably, it was the invention of the auto loan by Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors and the later financial innovation by the Roosevelt administration of the Federal Housing Authority and the home mortgage that created the US middle class, he noted. &#8220;Mortgages are time machines that let you have the future you want today.&#8221; We need something similar for the electrification transformation. Otherwise, &#8220;only rich people can afford to decarbonize today.&#8221;</p>\n",

Two decades later, Google too was highly profitable when it went public, and while Amazon was one of the first companies to legitimize the profitless IPO, <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-amazons-history-of-ipo-era-losses-means-little-for-todays-unprofitable-unicorns/\">its losses were falling as it grew</a>.

All these companies have valuations in the tens of billions, making their founders and investors very rich, despite not making any money at all in the operating economy.

Some of these companies may eventually turn an operating profit, but it is likely that when they do, investors will realize that those profits don’t justify the sky-high valuations, which will then come back down to earth.

Synthetic genomes aren&#8217;t subject to privacy laws, because they don&#8217;t belong to any person. Data limitations aren’t a new problem; AI researchers frequently face the problem of finding sufficient data to train a model. So they have developed a lot of techniques for generating &#8220;synthetic&#8221; data: for example, cropping, rotating, or distorting pictures to get more data for image recognition. Once you’ve realized that it’s possible to create synthetic data, the jump to creating synthetic genomes isn’t far-fetched; you just have to make the connection.

The data that powers ML applications is as important as code, making version control difficult; outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic, making testing difficult; training a model is processor intensive and time consuming, making rapid build/deploy cycles difficult.

GPT-3 is being delivered via an API, not by incorporating the model directly into applications. Is “Language-as-a-service” the future? GPT-3 is great at creating English text, but has no concept of common sense or even facts; for example, it has recommended suicide as a cure for depression.&nbsp; Can more sophisticated language models overcome those limitations?&nbsp; GPT-3 reflects the biases and prejudices that are built into languages. How are those to be overcome, and is that the responsibility of the model or of the application developers?&nbsp; GPT-3 is the most exciting development to appear during the last year; in 2021, our attention will remain focused on it and its successors. We can’t help but be excited (and maybe a little scared) by GPT-4.</p>\n",

We are starting to see some simpler alternatives for specific use cases–for example, K3S for edge computing.&nbsp; Will that trend continue?&nbsp; Or will Kubernetes be subsumed into cloud providers’ management consoles in a way that simplifies the options available to developers (aka “opinionated”)? We don’t know, but we believe that an important trend for the next year will be attempts to simplify cloud orchestration.</p>\n",

      "<p>The sea change in workplace dynamics brought about by Covid 19 has had a parallel effect on the world of site reliability engineering. Companies for whom an online presence was an afterthought are now finding it essential to survival. And they’re also finding it necessary to keep their online presence available 24&#215;7. So we foresee an increase in the demand for site reliability engineers–but beyond that, we expect an emphasis on the tools that SREs need. Look for a heavy emphasis on system observability and its fruits: high speed, actionable data allowing engineers to understand, prevent, and mitigate outages. Although it’s only part of the story, we’re particularly interested in OpenTelemetry, a vendor neutral standard for collecting system data. OpenTelementery promises an array of more refined and calibrated open source tools for observability in the years ahead.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>For a decade or more, the slogan “Infrastructure as Code” has driven efforts to make configuration programmable. We’ve made lots of progress; and perhaps the best example of that progress is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the deployment, creation, and construction of containers. There’s one more piece (for now) to consider: how do you automate the configuration of Kubernetes itself? How do you make new deployments faster, while minimizing the possibility of human error at the same time? That’s achieved by using Git to manage Kubernetes’ configuration files and any other artifacts it needs to run. When anything changes, a Kubernetes operator manages the process of informing Kubernetes and related orchestration tools and gradually pushing the deployed system to the desired state. GitOps may be the ultimate expression of “Infrastructure as Code”; we expect it to have a big impact in the coming year.</p>\n",

What’s more important is how organizations respond to those threats. In the past, most companies have taken a reactive approach to security: address breaches as they happen, and if nothing happens, they’ve spent too much on security. That approach has failed time and time again. In the coming year, we expect companies to take a dynamic, holistic approach that strengthens their security posture. Steps towards resilience include having a robust Identity and Access Management policy by implementing zero trust, MFA, and passwordless authentication.&nbsp; Expect to see increased use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) by both good and bad actors. Bad actors will use AI to find and exploit new vulnerabilities (including vulnerabilities in AI systems themselves); security teams will use AI and ML tools to detect and block attacks, and to automate routine tasks.</p>\n",

But that’s not reality.&nbsp; As IBM has said frequently, the cloud is a capability, not a destination.&nbsp; By the time most companies start thinking seriously about a “cloud strategy,” they already have pilot projects in multiple clouds.&nbsp; Mergers and acquisitions complicate the situation even more, as does data that has to remain on-premises for regulatory or security reasons. What counts isn’t moving applications to a specific provider, but having a uniform interface that lets you use capabilities regardless of their physical location. 2021 will be the year that companies (officially) adopt multi- and hybrid clouds, removing the operational and developmental barriers between their own, on-premises IT and cloud providers.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What is free speech, anyway?&nbsp; In a strictly legal sense, “free speech” is only a term that makes sense in the context of government regulation. The First Amendment to the US constitution says that the government can’t pass a law that restricts your speech. And neither Twitter nor Facebook are the US government, so whatever they do to block content isn’t a “free speech” issue, at least strictly interpreted.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Admittedly, that narrow view leaves out a lot. Both the right and the left can agree that we don’t really want Zuck or @jack determining what kinds of speech are legitimate. And most of us can agree that there’s a time when abstract principles have to give way to concrete realities, such as terrorists storming the US capitol building. That situation resulted from years of abusive speech that the social platforms had ignored, so that when the corporate power finally stepped in, their actions were too little, too late.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But as I said, the focus on “free speech” misframes the issue. The important issue here isn’t speech itself; it’s how and why speech is amplified—an amplification that can be used to drown out or intimidate other voices, or to selectively amplify voices for reasons that may be well-intended, self-interested, or even hostile to the public interest. The discussion we need, the discussion of amplification and its implications, has largely been supplanted by arguments about “free speech.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In the Third Amendment, the US Constitution also guarantees a “free press.” A free press is important because the press has the power of replication: of taking speech and making it available more broadly. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, that largely meant newspapers, which had the ability to reproduce tens of thousands of copies overnight. But freedom of the press has an important limitation. Anyone can talk, but to have freedom of the press you have to have a press–whether that’s a typewriter and a mimeograph, or all the infrastructure of a publisher like The New York TImes, CNN, or Fox News. And being a “press” has its own constraints: an editorial staff, an editorial policy, and so on. Because they’re in the business of replication, it’s probably more correct to think of Twitter and Facebook as exercising “press” functions.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But what is the editorial function for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and most other social media platforms? There isn’t an editor who decides whether your writing is insightful. There’s no editorial viewpoint. There’s only the shallowest attempt to verify facts. The editorial function is driven entirely by the desire to increase engagement, and this is done algorithmically. And what algorithms have “learned” perhaps isn’t surprising: showing people content that makes them angry is the best way to keep them coming back for more. And the more they come back, the more ads are clicked, and the more income flows in. Over the past few years, that editorial strategy has certainly played into the hands of the alt-right and neo-Nazi groups, who learned quickly how to take advantage of it. Nor have left-leaning polemicists missed the opportunity. The battle of overheated rhetoric has cheapened the public discourse and made consensus almost unattainable. Indeed, it has made attention itself unattainable: and, as Peter Wang has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pwang/52253dbfe627\">argued</a>, scarcity of attention–particularly the “synchronous attention of a group”–is the biggest problem we face, because it rules out thoughtful consensus.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Again, that’s been discussed many times over the past few years, but we seem to have lost that thread. We’ve had reproduction—we’ve had a press—but with the worst possible kind of editorial values. There are plenty of discussions of journalistic values and ethics that might be appropriate; but an editorial policy that has no other value than increasing engagement doesn’t even pass the lowest bar. And that editorial policy has left the user communities of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other media vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/defusing-propaganda-feedback-loops-on-the-social-web/\">deafening feedback loops</a>. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Social media feedback loops can be manipulated in many ways: by automated systems that reply or “like” certain kinds of content, as well as by individual users who can also reply and “like” by the thousands.&nbsp; And those loops are aided by the platforms’ recommendation systems: either by recommending specific inflammatory posts, or by recommending that users join specific groups. An internal Facebook report showed that, by their own reckoning, 70% of all “civic” groups on Facebook contained “<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/70-of-top-civic-facebook-groups-are-toxic-or-violent-report-finds/\">hate speech, misinformation, violent rhetoric, or other toxic behavior</a>”; and the company has been aware of that since 2016.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So where are we left?&nbsp; I would rather not have Zuck and @jack determine what kinds of speech are acceptable. That’s not the editorial policy we want.&nbsp; And we certainly need protections for people saying unpopular things on social media; eliminating those protections cuts both ways. What needs to be controlled is different altogether: it’s the optimization function that maximizes engagement, measured by time spent on the platform. And we do want to hold Zuck and @jack responsible for that optimization function, just as we want the publisher of a newspaper or a television news channel to be responsible for the headlines they write and what they put on their front page. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Simply stripping Section 230 protection strikes me as irrelevant to dealing with what Shoshana Zuboff terms an “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html\">epistemic coup</a>.” Is the right solution to do away with algorithmic engagement enhancement entirely?&nbsp; Facebook’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-groups/facebook-says-it-will-permanently-stop-recommending-political-groups-to-users-idUSKBN29X00C\">stop recommending political groups to users</a> is a step forward. But they need to go much farther in stripping algorithmic enhancement from their platform. Detecting bots would be a start; a better algorithm for “engagement,” one that promotes well-being rather than anger, would be a great ending point. As Apple CEO Tim Cook, clearly thinking about Facebook, recently <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/tim-cook-may-have-just-ended-facebook.html\">said</a>, &#8220;A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe&#8230;We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for you… It&#8217;s technology that helps you sleep, not keeps you up. It tells you when you&#8217;ve had enough. It gives you space to create or draw or write or learn, not refresh just one more time.&#8221;&nbsp; This reflects Apple’s values rather than Facebook’s (and one would do well to reflect on Facebook’s origins at Harvard); but it is leading towards the right question.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Making people angry might increase shareholder value short-term. But that probably isn’t a sustainable business; and if it is, it’s a business that does incredible social damage. The “solution” isn’t likely to be legislation; I can’t imagine laws that regulate algorithms effectively, and that can&#8217;t be gamed by people who are willing to work hard to game them. I guarantee that those people are out there. We can’t say that the solution is to “be better people,” because there are plenty of people who don’t want to be better; just look at the reaction to the pandemic. Just look at the frustration of the many Facebook and Twitter employees who realized that the time to lay aside abstract principles like “free speech” was long before the election. </p>\n",

We’ve explored usage across all publishing partners and learning modes, from live training courses and online events to interactive functionality provided by Katacoda and Jupyter notebooks. We’ve included search data in the graphs, although we have avoided using search data in our analysis. Search data is distorted by how quickly customers find what they want: if they don’t succeed, they may try a similar search with many of the same terms. (But don’t even think of searching for R or C!) Usage data shows what content our members actually use, though we admit it has its own problems: usage is biased by the content that’s available, and there’s no data for topics that are so new that content hasn’t been developed.</p>\n",

We suspect that the latter group is somewhat more conservative than the former. In practice, this means that we may have less meaningful data on the latest JavaScript frameworks or the newest programming languages. New frameworks appear every day (literally), and our corporate clients won’t suddenly tell their staff to reimplement the ecommerce site just because last year’s hot framework is no longer fashionable.</p>\n",

That may not be surprising, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in the technology industry. Companies that once resisted working from home were suddenly shutting down their offices and asking their staff to work remotely. Many have said that remote work will remain an option indefinitely. COVID had a significant effect on training: in-person training (whether on- or off-site) was no longer an option, so organizations of all sizes increased their participation in live online training, which grew by 96%. More traditional modes also saw increases: usage of books increased by 11%, while videos were up 24%. We also added two new learning modes, Katacoda scenarios and Jupyter notebooks, during the year; we don’t yet have enough data to see how they’re trending. </p>\n",

Although we believe that Rust’s popularity will continue to grow, don’t get too excited; it’s easy to grow 94% when you’re starting from a small base. Go has clearly established itself, particularly as a language for concurrent programming, and Rust is likely to establish itself for “system programming”: building new operating systems and tooling for cloud operations. Julia, a language designed for mathematical computation, is an interesting wild card. It’s slightly down over the past year, but we’re optimistic about its long term chances.</p>\n",

The same is true for JavaScript, with the React, Angular, and Node.js frameworks. With Python, the most heavily used libraries are PyTorch and scikit-learn.

Adding usage and search query data for Spring (up 7%) reverses Java’s apparent decline (net-zero growth). Zero growth isn’t inappropriate for an established enterprise language, particularly one owned by a company that has mired the language in controversy. Looking further at JavaScript, if you add in usage for the most popular frameworks (React, Angular, and Node.js), JavaScript usage on O’Reilly online learning rises to 50% of Python’s, only slightly behind Java and its frameworks.

And although it’s widely used, we didn’t assign TensorFlow to any language; it has bindings for Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and it’s not clear which language predominates. (Google Trends suggests C++.)

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul><li><em>Multiparadigm languages</em><br />Since last year, O’Reilly online learning has seen a 14% increase in the use of content on functional programming. However, Haskell and Erlang, the classic functional languages, aren’t where the action is; neither shows significant usage, and both are headed down (roughly 20% decline year over year). Object oriented programming is up even more than functional programming: 29% growth since last year. This suggests that the real story is the integration of functional features into procedural and object-oriented languages. Starting with Python 3.0 in 2008 and continuing with Java 8 in 2014, programming languages have added higher-order functions (lambdas) and other “functional” features. Several popular languages (including JavaScript and Go) have had functional features from the beginning. This trend started over 20 years ago (with the Standard Template Library for C++), and we expect it to continue.<br /></li><li><em>Concurrent programming</em><br />Platform data for concurrency shows an 8% year-over-year increase. This isn’t a large number, but don’t miss the story because the numbers are small. Java was the first widely used language to support concurrency as part of the language. In the mid-’90s, thread support was a luxury; Moore’s law had plenty of room to grow. That’s no longer the case, and support for concurrency, like support for functional programming, has become table stakes. Go, Rust, and most other modern languages have built-in support for concurrency. Concurrency has always been one of Python’s weaknesses.<br /></li><li><em>Dynamic versus static typing </em><br />This is another important paradigmatic axis. The distinction between languages with dynamic typing (like Ruby and JavaScript) and statically typed languages (like Java and Go) is arguably more important than the distinction between functional and object-oriented languages. Not long ago, the idea of adding static typing to dynamic languages would have started a brawl. No longer. Combining paradigms to form a hybrid is taking a hold here too. Python 3.5 added type hinting, and more recent versions have added additional static typing features. TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript, is coming into its own (12% year-over-year increase).<br /></li><li><em>Low-code and no-code computing</em><br />It’s hard for a learning platform to gather data about a trend that minimizes the need to learn, but low-code is real and is bound to have an effect. Spreadsheets were the forerunner of low-code computing. When VisiCalc was first released in 1979, it enabled millions to do significant and important computation without learning a programming language. Democratization is an important trend in many areas of technology; it would be surprising if programming were any different. </li></ul>\n",

The question is, What’s the trade-off? Here’s my version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Pareto principle</a>, also known as the 80/20 rule. Given any system (like Kubernetes), it’s usually possible to build something simpler by keeping the most widely used 80% of the features and cutting the other 20%. And some applications will fit within the 80% of the features that were kept. But most applications (maybe 80% of them?) will require at least one of the features that were sacrificed to make the system simpler.<br /></li><li>An entirely new approach, some tool that isn’t yet on the horizon. We have no idea what that tool is. In Yeats’s words, “What rough beast&#8230;slouches towards Bethlehem to be born”? <br /></li><li>An integrated solution from a cloud vendor (for example, Microsoft’s open source <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-dapr-distributed-runtime-nears-production-readiness/\">Dapr distributed runtime</a>). I don’t mean cloud vendors that provide Kubernetes as a service; we already have those.

Two trends are responsible for this. Ansible appears to have supplanted Chef and Puppet, possibly because Ansible is multilingual, while Chef and Puppet are tied to Ruby. Second, Docker and Kubernetes have changed the configuration game. Our data shows that Chef and Puppet peaked in 2017, when Kubernetes started an almost exponential growth spurt, as Figure 4 shows.

It’s been suggested that model training doesn’t need to be part of the build process, but that’s really the most important part of the application. Testing is critical to continuous deployment, but the behavior of AI systems is probabilistic, not deterministic, so it’s harder to say that this test or that test failed.

But WebAssembly represents a major rethinking of web programming and bears watching closely. Could WebAssembly turn JavaScript’s dominance of web development on its head? We suspect that nothing will happen quickly. Enterprise customers will be reluctant to bear the cost of moving from an older framework like PHP to a more fashionable JavaScript framework. It costs little to stick with an old stalwart.</p>\n",

We’ve already noted that JavaScript is one of the top programming languages—and the modern web platforms are nothing if not the apotheosis of JavaScript. We find that chilling. The original vision for the World Wide Web was radically empowering and democratizing. You didn’t need to be a techno-geek; you didn’t even need to program—you could just click “view source” in the browser and copy bits you liked from other sites. Twenty-five years later, that’s no longer true: you can still “view source,” but all you’ll see is a lot of incomprehensible JavaScript. Ironically, just as other technologies are democratizing, web development is increasingly the domain of programmers. Will that trend be reversed by a new generation of platforms, or by a reformulation of the web itself? We shall see.</p>\n",

Usage of cloud titles that don’t mention a specific vendor (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) grew at an even faster rate (46%). Our customers don’t see the cloud through the lens of any single platform. We’re only at the beginning of cloud adoption; while <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/cloud-adoption-in-2020/\">most companies</a> are using cloud services in some form, and many have moved significant business-critical applications and datasets to the cloud, we have a long way to go.

Use of content about Azure shows 136% growth—more than any of the competitors—while Google Cloud’s 84% growth is hardly shabby. When you dominate a market the way AWS dominates the cloud, there’s nowhere to go but down.

Google’s problem hasn’t been its ability to deliver leading-edge technology but rather its ability to reach customers—a problem that Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud’s CEO, is <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/how-thomas-kurian-s-quite-simple-strategy-is-transforming-google-cloud\">attempting to address</a>. Ironically, part of Google’s customer problem is its focus on engineering to the detriment of the customers themselves. Any number of people have told us that they stay away from Google because they’re too likely to say, “Oh, that service you rely on? We’re shutting it down; we have a better solution.” Amazon and Microsoft don’t do that; they understand that a cloud provider has to support legacy software, and that all software is legacy the moment it’s released.</p>\n",

These are new products, for which little content exists, so low usage isn’t surprising. But the usage of specific cloud technologies isn’t that important in this context; what’s more important is that usage of all the cloud platforms is growing, particularly content that isn’t tied to any vendor. We also see that our corporate clients are using content that spans all the cloud vendors; it’s difficult to find anyone who’s looking at a single vendor.</p>\n",

      "<p>Not long ago, we were skeptical about hybrid and multicloud. It’s easy to assume that these concepts are pipe dreams springing from the minds of vendors who are in second, third, fourth, or fifth place: if you can’t win customers from Amazon, at least you can get a slice of their business. That story isn’t compelling—but it’s also the wrong story to tell. Cloud computing is hybrid by nature. Think about how companies “get into the cloud.” It’s often a chaotic grassroots process rather than a carefully planned strategy. An engineer can’t get the resources for some project, so they create an AWS account, billed to the company credit card. Then someone in another group runs into the same problem, but goes with Azure. Next there’s an acquisition, and the new company has built its infrastructure on Google Cloud. And there’s petabytes of data on-premises, and that data is subject to regulatory requirements that make it difficult to move. The result? Companies have hybrid clouds long before anyone at the C-level perceives the need for a coherent cloud strategy. By the time the C suite is building a master plan, there are already mission-critical apps in marketing, sales, and product development. And the one way to fail is to dictate that “we’ve decided to unify on cloud X.”</p>\n",

They know that support for hybrid clouds is key to cloud adoption–and, if there is any lock in, it will be around management.

Perhaps a better comparison would be to compare security with a general topic like programming or cloud. If we take that approach, programming usage is heavier than security, and security is only slightly behind cloud.

      "<p>We’ve taken a tour through a significant portion of the technology landscape. We’ve reported on the horse races along with the deeper stories underlying those races. Trends aren’t just the latest fashions; they’re also long-term processes. Containerization goes back to <a href=\"https://www.section.io/engineering-education/history-of-container-technology/\">Unix version 7 in 1979</a>; and didn’t Sun Microsystems invent the cloud in the 1990s with its workstations and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ray\">Sun Ray</a> terminals? We may talk about “internet time,” but the most important trends span decades, not months or years—and often involve reinventing technology that was useful but forgotten, or technology that surfaced before its time.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>With that in mind, let’s take several steps back and think about the big picture. How are we going to harness the computing power needed for AI applications? We’ve talked about concurrency for decades, but it was only an exotic capability important for huge number-crunching tasks. That’s no longer true; we’ve run out of Moore’s law, and concurrency is table stakes. We’ve talked about system administration for decades, and during that time, the ratio of IT staff to computers managed has gone from many-to-one (one mainframe, many operators) to one-to-thousands (monitoring infrastructure in the cloud). As part of that evolution, automation has also gone from an option to a necessity. </p>\n",

      "<p>We’ve all heard that “everyone should learn to program.” This may be correct&#8230;or maybe not. It doesn’t mean that everyone should be a professional programmer but that everyone should be able to use computers effectively, and that requires programming. Will that be true in the future? No-code and low-code products are reaching the market, allowing users to build everything from business applications to AI prototypes. Again, this trend goes way back: in the late 1950s, the first modern programming languages made programming much easier. And yes, even back then there were those who said “real men use machine language.” (And that sexism was no doubt intentional, since the first generation of programmers included many women.) Will our future bring further democratization? Or a return to a cult of “wizards”? Low-code AI and complex JavaScript web platforms offer conflicting visions of what the future may bring.</p>\n",

      "<p>Finally, the most important trend may not yet appear in our data at all. Technology has largely gotten a free ride as far as regulation and legislation are concerned. Yes, there are heavily regulated sectors like healthcare and finance, but social media, much of machine learning, and even much of online commerce have only been lightly regulated. That free ride is coming to an end. Between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>, the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (which will probably be copied by many states), California Propositions <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/22/\">22</a> and <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/24/\">24</a>, many <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition\">city ordinances</a> regarding the use of face recognition, and rethinking the meaning of <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-next-section-230-roundup-proposals\">Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act, laws and regulations will play a big role in shaping technology in the coming years. Some of that regulation was inevitable, but a lot of it is a direct response to an industry that moved too fast and broke too many things. In this light, the lack of interest in privacy and related topics is unhealthy. Twenty years ago, we built a future that we don’t really want to live in.

Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, interpretability of AI system mechanisms enables human trust and understanding of these high-impact technologies, meaningful recourse interventions, and proper system documentation. Over recent years, two promising technological approaches have increased AI systems&#8217; interpretability: interpretable ML models and post-hoc explanations. Interpretable ML models (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/interpretml/interpret\">explainable boosting machines</a>) are algorithms that are both highly accurate and highly transparent. Post-hoc explanations (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slundberg/shap\">Shapley values</a>) attempt to summarize ML model mechanisms and decisions. These two tools can be used together to increase your AI’s transparency.

Even if your organization takes the utmost precaution, any incidents involving your AI system, even if they stem from a third-party you relied on, can potentially be blamed on you.

      "<p>A few months ago, I said that &#8220;making everything into a design pattern is a sign that you don&#8217;t know what design patterns really are.&#8221; So now, I feel obliged to say something about what design patterns are.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Design patterns are frequently observed solutions to common problems. The idea comes from the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander\">Christopher Alexander</a> in architecture; patterns are things like &#8220;rooms on both sides of a hallway&#8221; or &#8220;door on the front of a building.&#8221;&nbsp; There’s a lot we can unpack from this simple definition:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul><li>Design patterns are not invented.&nbsp; They are observed. They aren’t about inventing (or re-inventing) wheels; they’re about noticing “I’ve put wheels on three things lately. Might be a good idea…” The first time you put wheels on something is an invention.&nbsp; It becomes a pattern when you observe that you’re re-inventing the wheel, and that’s a good thing. The wheel becomes part of your repertoire of solutions.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are not algorithms, which are specific solutions to generalized problems.&nbsp;Quicksort isn’t a pattern–nor is sorting itself.&nbsp; Patterns have more to do with how software is organized. They are more like stories, in which a problem leads to a solution that coordinates a number of different parts.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are often used without thinking; they feel natural, not clever, and that’s why they’re common. You’ll find them in your code; you’ll find them in the code of others.&nbsp; You can find them even if they weren’t put there consciously; patterns are often no more than a common solution to a certain kind of problem, something that looks obvious in retrospect. Patterns become a problem when programmers try to force the issue–to use patterns where they don’t quite fit, because they’ve heard that design patterns make their code better.<br /></li><li>Design patterns aren&#8217;t inherently good–and if you read Alexander, you’ll find that there are plenty of architectural patterns that he really doesn’t like. A corridor with rooms on both sides is a solution to certain architectural problems. It is frequently found in very boring hotels and offices.<br /></li><li>&#8220;Anti-patterns&#8221; may be worth avoiding, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t patterns. Frequently observed bad solutions to common problems are still frequently observed solutions to common problems. And sometimes, anti-patterns will be the best possible solution to an otherwise intractable problem. That’s the kind of technical debt that enables you to ship, as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-exactitude-in-technical-debt/\">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href=\"https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html\">Ward Cunningham</a> have written.</li></ul>\n",

      "<p>There isn’t any magic here. While the book <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/\">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (the “Gang of Four”) is a classic, design patterns really aren’t things you look up in books. Design patterns are things you find in your code; they’d probably be there whether or not they had a name. So what’s the value?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The biggest value in design patterns is that it gives us a common language for talking about software and how it’s organized. That’s why Alexander named one of his books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/\">A Pattern Language</a>. We’ve all spent hours making diagrams on black- or white-boards to show how some software we’re writing is organized. Design patterns give a common vocabulary so that we can discuss software with some certainty that we all mean the same thing. I eventually realized that UML had the same aim: UML diagrams are like architectural blueprints, in which one kind of line represents a brick wall, another wood, another plasterboard. Unfortunately, UML was never quite standard enough, and like design patterns, was perceived as a good in itself. In the end, a common vocabulary (whether a pattern catalog or UML) is a tool, and any tool can be abused.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Since the Gang of Four, design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming, but the idea that patterns aren’t applicable to functional languages is itself meaningless. It’s certainly true that in functional languages, some well-known patterns (like strategy or map/reduce) are either primitives or simple library functions; but saying that there aren’t patterns in functional programming is equivalent to saying that there are no common solutions to common problems. It’s still useful to point out that the “strategy” pattern is equivalent to passing a function as a parameter to another function. That language gives you an intuitive and descriptive way to discuss solutions to a problem.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Patterns change over time, as problems change; there’s nothing special to the patterns the Gang of Four observed in the 1990s. In the 2020s, we should be building a pattern language for concurrent programming–and we may find that our patterns for the enterprise software of the 90s are less relevant.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>You may find that you use patterns without thinking about it; you may discover patterns in your code; you may realize you&#8217;re facing a problem that a pattern will help you to solve; or you may use patterns to describe solutions to someone else. When solving a problem, sometimes the only thing you’re missing is a name; having a name for your solution crystallizes it. Studying patterns is useful because it gives you a larger vocabulary with which to think about problems and solutions. But using patterns for their own sake leads you nowhere. I remember hearing about programmers boasting about how many Gang of Four patterns they used, and managers telling programmers to use more patterns.&nbsp; That’s not productive.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Like any good thing in programming, using design patterns should help you solve complex problems more simply. But there&#8217;s no guarantee that they&#8217;ll do that. And if you find that they aren&#8217;t, then you should research for some other solutions.</p>\n",

      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/f62LG1ACBmI/\n",
      "<p>It has long seemed to me that functional programming is, essentially, programming viewed as mathematics. Many ideas in functional programming came from Alonzo Church&#8217;s Lambda Calculus, which significantly predates anything that looks remotely like a modern computer. Though the actual history of computing runs differently: in the early days of computing, Von Neumann’s ideas were more important than Church’s, and had a tremendous influence on the design of early computers—an influence that continues to the present. Von Neumann’s thinking was essentially imperative: a program is a list of commands that run on a machine designed to execute those commands.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So, what does it mean to say that functional programming is programming &#8220;viewed as mathematics&#8221;? Von Neumann was a “mathematician,” and programming of all kinds found its first home in Mathematics departments. So, if functional programming is mathematical, what does that mean? What kind of math?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I’m not thinking of any specific branch of mathematics. Yes, the Lambda Calculus has significant ties to set theory, logic, category theory, and many other branches of mathematics. But let’s start with grade school mathematics and assignment statements; they&#8217;re basic to any programming language. We&#8217;re all familiar with code like this:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1 # or, more simply\n",
      "&nbsp; i += 1&nbsp; # or, even more simply\n",
      "&nbsp; i++ &nbsp; &nbsp; # C, Java, but not Python or Ruby</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Mathematically, this is nonsense. An equation is a statement about a relationship that holds true. <code>i</code> can equal <code>i</code>; it can&#8217;t equal <code>i+1</code>. And while <code>i++</code> and <code>i+=1</code> no longer look like equations, they are equally nonsensical; once you&#8217;ve said that <code>i</code> equals something, you can&#8217;t say it equals something else. &#8220;Variables&#8221; don&#8217;t change values; they&#8217;re immutable.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Immutability is one of the most important principles of functional programming. Once you&#8217;ve defined a variable, you can&#8217;t change it. (You can create a new one in a different function scope, but that&#8217;s a different matter.) Variables, in functional programming, are invariant; and that&#8217;s important. You may be wondering &#8220;what about loops? How can I write a <code>for</code> loop?&#8221; Not only do you have to do without index variables, you can’t modify any of the variables in the loop body.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Setting aside the (solvable) problem of iteration, there’s no reason you can&#8217;t write code in (almost) any non-functional language that has this same effect. Just declare all your variables <code>final</code> or <code>const</code>. In the long run, functional programming is more about a specific kind of discipline than about language features. Programming languages can enforce certain rules, but in just about any modern language it&#8217;s possible to follow those rules without language support.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another important principle of functional programming is that functions are &#8220;first class entities.&#8221; That is, there are minimal restrictions about where you can use a function. You can also have functions without names, often called &#8220;lambdas” (which refers directly to the Lambda Calculus, in which functions were unnamed).&nbsp; In Python, you can write code like this:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;data.sort(key=lambda r: r[COLUMN])</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The &#8220;key&#8221; is an anonymous function that returns a specific column of an array; that function is then used for sorting. Personally, I&#8217;m not overly fond of &#8220;anonymous functions&#8221;; it&#8217;s often clearer to write the anonymous function as a regular, named function. So I might write this:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def sortbycolumn(r): return r[COLUMN]\n",
      "&nbsp; data.sort(k=sortbycolumn)</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The ability to use functions as arguments to functions gives you a very nice way to implement the &#8220;strategy pattern&#8221;:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def squareit(x): &nbsp; return x*x\n",
      "&nbsp; def cubeit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; return x*x*x\n",
      "  def rootit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; import math; return math.sqrt(x)\n",
      "&nbsp; def do_something(strategy, x) ...\n",
      "\n",
      "  do_something(cubeit, 42)\n",
      "  weird = lambda x : cubeit(rootit(x))\n",
      "  do_something(weird, 42)</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I often get the sense that all programmers really<em> </em>want from functional programming is first-class functions and lambdas. Lambdas were added to Python very early on (1.0) but didn&#8217;t reach Java until Java 8.&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another consequence of thinking mathematically (and possibly a more important one) is that functions can&#8217;t have side-effects and, given the same arguments, will always return the same value. If a mathematician (or a high school trig student) writes</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;y = sin(x)</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>they don&#8217;t have to deal with the possibility that <code>sin(x)</code> sets some global variable to 42, or will return a different value every time it’s called. That just can&#8217;t happen; in math, the idea of a &#8220;side-effect&#8221; is meaningless. All the information that <code>sin(x)</code> provides is encapsulated in the return value. In most programming languages, side-effects happen all too easily, and in some, they&#8217;re almost an obsession. Again, creating functions that have no side-effects is a matter of exercising discipline. A programming language can enforce this rule, but you can follow it whether or not your language makes you do it. We don’t have cartoon devils looking over our shoulders saying &#8220;Go ahead; make a side effect. No one will notice.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Functional languages vary the degree to which they enforce the lack of side-effects. If you&#8217;re a purist, anything that interacts with the real world is a side-effect. Printing a document? Changing a row in a database? Displaying a value on the user&#8217;s screen? Those are all side-effects (they aren&#8217;t completely encapsulated in the value returned by the function), and they have to be &#8220;hidden&#8221; using a mechanism like monads in Haskell. And that&#8217;s the point at which many programmers get confused and throw up their hands in despair. (I&#8217;ll only point you to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-world-haskell/9780596155339/\">Real World Haskell</a>.) In both Java and Python, lambda functions can have side-effects, which means that, strictly speaking, they aren’t really “functional.” Guido van Rossum&#8217;s discussion of the addition of Lambdas to Python is worth reading; among other things, he <a href=\"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> &#8220;I have never considered Python to be heavily influenced by functional languages, no matter what people say or think.&#8221;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Streams are often associated with functional languages; they’re essentially long (perhaps infinite) lists that are evaluated lazily—meaning that elements of the string are only evaluated as they&#8217;re needed. Maps apply a function to every element of a list, returning a new list—and that includes streams, which (for these purposes) are specialized lists. That&#8217;s an incredibly useful feature; it&#8217;s a great way to write a loop without having to write a loop—and without even knowing how much data you have. You can also create “filters” that choose whether to pass any element of the stream to the output, and you can chain maps and filters together. If you think this sounds like a Unix pipeline, you’re right. Streams, maps, filters, and the act of chaining them together really have as much to do with the Unix shell as they do with functional languages.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Another way to avoid writing loops is to use &#8220;comprehensions,&#8221; a feature of Python. It&#8217;s easy to get very fond of list comprehensions; they&#8217;re compact, they eliminate off-by-one errors, and they&#8217;re very flexible. Although comprehensions look like a compact notation for a traditional loop, they really come from set theory—and their closest computational “relatives” are to be found in relational databases, rather than functional programming. Here’s a comprehension that applies a function to every element of a list:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;# pythonic examples.&nbsp; First, list comprehension \n",
      "&nbsp; newlist = [ somefunction(thing) for thing in things ] </pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The most general way to avoid traditional loops is to use recursion: a function that calls itself. Here’s the recursive equivalent to the previous comprehension:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">def iterate(t, l) :\n",
      "    if len(t) == 0 : return l     # stop when all elements are done\n",
      "    return iterate(t[1:],l + [somefunction(t[0])]) # process remainder</pre>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Recursion is a mainstay of functional languages: you don’t have indices being modified, and you’re not even modifying the resulting list (assuming that append doesn’t count as modification).&nbsp;</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>However, recursion has its own problems. It&#8217;s hard to wrap your mind around recursion; you still need to do a lot of your own bookkeeping (in this case, passing in a vector so a result can be returned); and except in one (common) special case, called &#8220;tail recursion,&#8221; it can be a performance nightmare.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>I started by saying that functional programming was programming considered as “math,” and that’s at least partially correct. But is that claim useful? There are many branches of mathematics that map onto programming concepts in different ways. Functional programming only represents one of them. If you’re a topologist, you may well like graph databases. But discussing which branch of mathematics corresponds to which programming practices isn’t really helpful. Remembering high school algebra may help when thinking about immutability, statelessness, and the absence of side-effects; but most programmers will never study the real mathematical origins of functional programing. Lambdas are great; functions as arguments in method calls is great; even recursion is (sometimes) great; but we’re fooling ourselves if we think programmers are going to start using Java as if it were Haskell. But that’s OK; for Java programmers, the value of Lambdas isn’t some mathematical notion of “functional,” but in providing a huge improvement over anonymous inner classes. The tools to be functional are there, should you choose to use them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In college, I learned that engineering was about making tradeoffs. Since then, I’ve heard very few programmers talk about tradeoffs—but those tradeoffs are still central to good engineering. And while engineering uses a lot of mathematics, engineering isn’t mathematics, in part because mathematics doesn’t deal in tradeoffs. Using “mathematics” as a way to think about a particular style of disciplined coding maybe be useful, particularly if that discipline leads to fewer bugs. It’s also useful to use the tools of mathematics to make good tradeoffs between rigor, performance, and practicality—which may lead you in an entirely different direction. Be as functional as you need to (but no more).&nbsp;<br /></p>\n",

Consider that, for example, duplication is sometimes used to reduce coupling, so the debit becomes a credit in that context. We can conclude that a code smell is not an isolated thing with a single look-up debt value, so this is clearly a more complex problem dependent on many factors. As a multivariable problem, what does it depend on? And how? And how do we know? And what would the value or—more likely—value distribution reflect? The cost of fixing?

      "<p>The programming world used to be split into functional languages, object-oriented languages, and everything else (mostly procedural languages). One &#8220;was&#8221; a functional programmer (at least as a hobby) writing Lisp, Haskell, or Erlang; or one &#8220;was&#8221; an OO programmer (at least professionally), writing code in Java or C++.  (One never called oneself a “procedural programmer”; when these names escaped from academia in the 1990s, calling yourself a “procedural programmer” would be akin to wearing wide ties and bell-bottom jeans.)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But this world has been changing. Over the past two decades, we&#8217;ve seen the rise of hybrid programming languages that combine both functional and object-oriented features. Some of these languages (like Scala) were multi-paradigm from the beginning. Others, like Python (in the transition from Python 2 to 3) or Java (with the introduction of Lambdas in Java 8) are object-oriented or procedural languages to which functional features were added. Although we think of C++ as an object-oriented language, it has also been multi-paradigm from the beginning. It started with C, a procedural language, and added object-oriented features. Later, beginning with the Standard Template Library, C++ was influenced by many ideas from Scheme, a descendant of LISP.  JavaScript was also heavily influenced by Scheme, and popularized the idea of anonymous functions and functions as first class objects. And JavaScript was object-oriented from the start, with a prototype-based object model and syntax (though not semantics) that gradually evolved to become similar to Java’s.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We’ve also seen the rise of languages combining static and dynamic typing (TypeScript in the JavaScript world; the addition of optional type hinting in Python 3.5; Rust has some limited dynamic typing features). Typing is another dimension in paradigm space. Dynamic typing leads to languages that make programming fun and where it’s easy to be productive, while strict typing makes it significantly easier to build, understand, and debug large systems. It’s always been easy to find people praising dynamic languages, but, except for a few years in the late 00s, the dynamic-static paradigmatic hasn’t attracted as much attention.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Why do we still see holy wars between advocates of functional and object-oriented programming? That strikes me as a huge missed opportunity. What might &#8220;multi-paradigm programming&#8221; mean? What would it mean to reject purity and use whatever set of features provide the best solution in any given context? Most significant software is substantial enough that it certainly has components where an object-oriented paradigm makes more sense, and components where a functional paradigm is superior.  For example, look at a “functional” feature like recursion.  There are certainly algorithms that make much more sense recursively (Towers of Hanoi, or printing a sorted binary tree in order); there are algorithms where it doesn’t make much of a difference whether you use loops or recursion (whenever tail recursion optimizations will work); and there are certainly cases where recursion will be slow and memory-hungry. How many programmers know which solution is best in any situation?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>These are the sort of questions we need to start asking. Design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming from the beginning. What kinds of design patterns make sense in a multi-paradigm world? Remember that design patterns aren&#8217;t &#8220;invented&#8221;; they&#8217;re observed, they&#8217;re solutions to problems that show up again and again, and that should become part of your repertoire. It&#8217;s unfortunate that functional programmers tend not to talk about design patterns; when you realize that patterns are observed solutions, statements like &#8220;patterns aren&#8217;t needed in functional languages&#8221; cease to make sense. Functional programmers certainly solve problems, and certainly see the same solutions show up repeatedly. We shouldn’t expect those problems and solutions to be the same problems and solutions that OO programmers observe. What patterns yield the best of both paradigms? What patterns might help to determine which approach is most appropriate in a given situation?</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Programming languages represent ways of thinking about problems. Over the years, the paradigms have multiplied, along with the problems we’re interested in solving. We now talk about event-driven programming, and many software systems are event-driven, at least on the front end. Metaprogramming was popularized by JUnit, the first widely used tool to rely on this feature that’s more often associated with functional languages; since then, several drastically different versions of metaprogramming have made new things possible in Java, Ruby, and other languages.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>We&#8217;ve never really addressed the problem of how to make these paradigms play well together; so far, languages that support multiple paradigms have left it to the programmers to figure out how to use them. But simply mixing paradigms ad hoc probably isn’t the ideal way to build large systems–and we&#8217;re now building software at scales and speeds that were hard to imagine only a few years ago. Our tools have improved; now we need to learn how to use them well. And that will inevitably involve blending paradigms that we’ve long viewed as distinct, or even in conflict.</p>\n",

This approach has two problems: (1) there may not be an appropriate license attached to the data, and (2) the data may not be a good representative sample for the intended use. It’s worth noting that the first issue is not just limited to images collected from the Internet. In recent years a number of research datasets (including Stanford’s Brainwash, Microsoft’s MS Celeb, and Duke’s MTMC) were withdrawn for reasons including a lack of clarity around the permission and rights granted by people appearing in the datasets. More recently, at least one company has earned itself significant PR and legal controversy for collecting training data sources from social media platforms under circumstances that were at least arguably a violation of both the platform’s terms of service and platform users&#8217; legal rights.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> One of the most interesting aspects of machine learning (ML) is its very broad applicability across a variety of industries and use cases. ML can be used to identify cats in photos as well as to guide autonomous vehicles. Understandably, the potential harm caused by showing a customer a dog when they expected to see a cat is significantly different from the potential harm caused by an autonomous driving model failing to properly recognize a stop sign.&nbsp; Determining the risk profile of a given model requires a case-by-case evaluation but it can be useful to think of the failure risk in three broad categories:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might die or have their sensitive data exposed”</em> — Examples of these kinds of uses include automated driving/flying systems and biometric access features. ML models directly involved in critical safety systems are generally easy to identify as areas of concern. That said, the risks involved require a very careful evaluation of the processes used to generate, test, and deploy those models, particularly in cases where there are significant public risks involved in any of the aforementioned steps.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might lose access to an important service”</em> — Say, payment fraud detection and social media content detection algorithms.&nbsp;Most of us have had the experience of temporarily losing access to a credit card for buying something that “didn’t fit our spending profile.” Recently, a law professor who <em>studies</em> automated content moderation was suspended … by a social media platform&#8217;s automated content moderation system. All this because they quoted a reporter who <em>writes</em> about automated content moderation. These kinds of service-access ML models are increasingly used to make decisions about what we can spend, what we can say, and even where and how we can travel. The end-user risks are not as critical as in a safety or data protection system, but their failure can represent a significant reputation risk to the business that uses them when the failure mode is to effectively ban users from a product or service. It is important for companies employing ML in these situations to understand how this all fits into the overall risk profile of the company. They&#8217;d do well to carefully weigh the relative merit of using ML to <em>augment</em> existing controls and human decision-making versus <em>replace</em> those controls and leave the model as the sole decision-maker.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, people may be mildly inconvenienced or embarrassed”</em> —&nbsp; Such systems include image classifiers, recommendation engines, and automated image manipulation tools. In my experience, companies significantly understate the potential downside for ML failures that, while only inconvenient to individual users, can carry significant PR risk in the aggregate. A company may think that failures in a shopping recommendation algorithm are “not a big deal” until the algorithm suggests highly inappropriate results to millions of users for an innocuous and very common query.&nbsp; Similarly, employees working on a face autodetection routine for a camera may think occasional failures are insignificant until the product is on sale and users discover that the feature fails to recognize faces with facial hair, or a particular hairstyle, or a particular range of skin color.</li></ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I use this question to determine both the potential risk from an individual failure and the potential aggregate risk from a systemic failure.&nbsp; It also feeds back into my question about training data: some relatively minor potential harms are worth additional investment in training data and testing if they could inconvenience millions, or billions, of users or create a significant negative PR cycle for a company.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> This is the sort of question that gets people thinking about the importance of their model in the overall business. It can also be a helpful guide that companies invest in such a model, and the kinds of business processes that are amenable to models.&nbsp; Remember that models that work nearly perfectly can still fail spectacularly in unusual situations.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> We don’t always have the luxury of time or accurate foresight.&nbsp;Sometimes a business does not know how a model will be used: a model is developed for Product X and repurposed for Product Y, a minor beta feature suddenly becomes an overnight success, or a business necessity unexpectedly forces a model into widespread production.</p>\n",

If the change is extremely urgent—a very high cost of doing nothing—it may warrant a quick fix now, soon followed by a more formal approach once the system is stable. A low cost of doing nothing, by comparison, means that we can define the project as &#8220;research&#8221; or &#8220;an experiment,&#8221; and move at a slower pace.</p>\n",

      "<p>From the customer perspective, downstream rights are tied to competition/cost tradeoffs and the rights associated with training data.&nbsp; A company that considers ML a competitive advantage likely will not want their models or derivative data available to competitors, and they must balance this against the business consideration that vendors which retain downstream rights typically charge lower fees (because reselling that data or models can be a source of revenue). In addition, training data usually comes with contractual limitations and customers of ML services need to ensure they are not granting downstream rights that they don’t have in their upstream agreements. Finally, some kinds of training data, such as medical records or classified government data, may forbid unauthorized access or use in systems that lack adequate safeguards and audit logs.</p>\n",

      "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The field of AI product management continues to gain momentum.

      "<p>One area that has received less attention is the role of an AI product manager <em>after the product is deployed</em>. In traditional software engineering, precedent has been established for the transition of responsibility from development teams to maintenance, user operations, and site reliability teams. New features in an existing product often follow a similar progression. For traditional software, the domain knowledge and skills required to develop new features differ from those necessary to ensure that the product works as intended. Because product development and product operations are distinct, it’s logical for different teams and processes to be responsible for them.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In contrast, many production AI systems rely on feedback loops that require the same technical skills used during initial development. Similarly, in “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product</a>,” Emmanuel Ameisen states: “Indeed, exposing a model to users in production comes with a set of challenges that mirrors the ones that come with debugging a model.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As a result, at the stage when product managers for other types of products might shift to developing new features (or to other projects altogether), an AI product manager and the rest of the original development team should remain heavily involved. One reason for this is to tackle the (likely) lengthy backlog of ML/AI model improvements that will be discovered after the product engages with the real world. Another, of course, is to ensure that the product functions as expected and desired over time. We describe the final responsibility of the AI PM as <em>coordinating with the engineering, infrastructure, and site reliability teams to ensure all shipped features can be supported at scale.</em></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This article offers our perspective into the practical details of the AI PM’s responsibilities in the latter parts of the AI product cycle, as well as some insight into best practices in execution of those responsibilities.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Debugging AI Products</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/\">Bringing an AI Product to Market</a>, we distinguished the debugging phase of product development from pre-deployment evaluation and testing. This distinction assumes a slightly different definition of debugging than is often used in software development. We define debugging as the process of using logging and monitoring tools to detect and resolve the inevitable problems that show up in a production environment.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Emmanuel Ameisen again offers a useful framework for defining errors in AI/ML applications: “&#8230;three areas in particular are most important to verify: inputs to a pipeline, the confidence of a model and the outputs it produces.” To support verification in these areas, a product manager must first ensure that the AI system is capable of reporting back to the product team about its performance and usefulness over time.&nbsp; This may manifest in several ways, including the collection of explicit user feedback or comments via channels outside of the product team, and the provision of mechanisms to dispute the output of the AI system where applicable. Proper AI product monitoring is essential to this outcome.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>I/O validation</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>From a technical perspective, it is entirely possible for ML systems to function on wildly different data. For example, you can ask an ML model to make an inference on data taken from a distribution very different from what it was trained on—but that, of course, results in unpredictable and often undesired performance. Therefore, deployed AI products should include validation steps to ensure that model inputs and outputs are within generally expected limits, before a model training or inference task is accepted as successful.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Ideally, AI PMs would steer development teams to incorporate I/O validation into the initial build of the production system, along with the instrumentation needed to monitor model accuracy and other technical performance metrics. But in practice, it is common for model I/O validation steps to be added later, when scaling an AI product. Therefore, the PM should consider the team that will reconvene whenever it is necessary to build out or modify product features that:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul><li>ensure that inputs are present and complete,</li><li>establish that inputs are from a realistic (expected) distribution of the data,</li><li>and trigger alarms, model retraining, or shutdowns (when necessary).</li></ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The composition of these teams will vary between companies and products, but a typical cross-functional team would likely include representatives from Data Science (for product-level experimentation and inference task validation), Applied Science (for model performance and evaluation), ML Engineering (for data and feature engineering, as well as model pipeline support) and Software/Feature Engineering (for integration with the full stack of the AI product—such as UI/UX, cloud services, and dev ops tools). Working together, this post-production development team should embrace continuous delivery principles, and prioritize the integration of any additional necessary instrumentation that was not already implemented during the model development process.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Finally, the AI PM must work with production engineering teams to design and implement the alerting and remediation framework. Considerations include where to set thresholds for each persona, alert frequency, and the degree of remediation automation (both what’s possible and desired).</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>Inference Task Speed and SLOs</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>During testing and evaluation, application performance is important, but not critical to success. In the production environment, when the outputs of an ML model are often a central (yet hidden) component of a greater application, speed and reliability are critically important. It is entirely possible for an AI product’s output to be absolutely correct from the perspective of accuracy and data quality, but too slow to be even remotely useful. Consider the case of autonomous vehicles: if the outputs from even one of the many critical ML models that comprise the vehicle’s AI-powered “vision” are delivered <em>after</em> a crash, who cares if they were correct?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In engineering for production, AI PMs must take into account the speed at which information from ML/AI models must be delivered (to validation tasks, to other systems in the product, and to users). Technologies and techniques—such as engineering specifically for GPU/TPU performance and caching—are important tools in the deployment process, but they are also additional components that can fail, and thus be responsible for the failure of an AI product’s core functionality. An AI PM’s responsibility is to ensure that the development team implements proper checks prior to release, and—in the case of failure—to support the incident response teams, until they are proficient in resolving issues independently.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>AI product managers must also consider availability: the degree to which the service that an AI product provides is <em>available</em> to other systems and users. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) provide a useful framework for encapsulating this kind of decision. In an <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">incident management blog post</a>, Atlassian defines SLOs as: “the individual promises you’re making to that customer… SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against. SLOs can be useful for both paid and unpaid accounts, as well as internal and external customers.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Service Level Indicators, Objectives, and Agreements (SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs) are well-known, frequently used, and well-documented tools for defining the availability of digital services.&nbsp; For cloud infrastructure some of the most common SLO types are concerned with availability, reliability and scalability. For AI products, these same concepts must be expanded to cover not just infrastructure, but also data and the system’s overall performance at a given task. While useful, these constructs are not beyond criticism. Chief among the challenges are: choosing the correct metrics to begin with, measuring and reporting once metrics are selected, and the lack of incentive for a service provider to update the service’s capabilities (which leads to outdated expectations). Despite these concerns, service level frameworks can be quite useful, and should be in the AI PM’s toolkit when designing the kind of experience that an AI product should provide.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>Durability</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>You must also take durability into account when building a post-production product plan. Even if well-designed, multi-layer fault detection and model retraining systems are carefully planned and implemented, every AI-powered system must be robust to the ever-changing and naturally stochastic environment that we (humans) all live in. Product managers should assume that any probabilistic component of an AI product will break at some point. A <em>good</em> AI product will be able to self-detect and alert experts upon such a failure; a <em>great </em>AI product will be able to detect the most common problems and adjust itself automatically—without significant interruption of services for users, or high-touch intervention by human experts.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are many ways to improve AI product durability, including:</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<ul><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/when-are-you-planning-to-retrain-your-machine-learning-model-5349eb0c4706\">Time-based model retraining</a>: retraining all core models periodically, regardless of performance.</li><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-models-degrade-in-production-d0f2108e9214\">Continuous retraining</a>: a data-driven approach that employs constant monitoring of the model’s key performance indicators and data quality thresholds.</li></ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It’s worth noting that model durability and retraining can raise legal and policy issues. For example, in many regulated industries, changing any core functionality of an AI system’s decision-making capability (i.e., objective functions, major changes to hyperparameters, etc.) require not only disclosure, but also monitored testing.&nbsp; As such, an AI Product Manager’s responsibility here extends to releasing not only a usable product, but one that can be ethically and legally consumed. It’s also important to remember that no matter what the approach to developing and maintaining a highly durable AI system, the product team must have access to high quality, relevant metrics on both model performance and functionality.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>Monitoring</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Proper monitoring (and the software instrumentation necessary to perform it) is essential to the success of an AI product. However, monitoring is a loaded term. The reasons for monitoring AI systems are often conflated, as are the different types of monitoring and alerting provided by off-the-shelf tools. Emmanuel Ameisen once again provides a useful and concise definition of model monitoring as a way to “track the health of a system. For models, this means monitoring their performance and the equity of their predictions.”</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The simplest case of model monitoring is to compute key performance metrics (related to both model fit and inference accuracy) regularly. These metrics can be combined with human-determined thresholds and automated alerting systems to inform when a model has “drifted” beyond normal operating parameters. While ML monitoring is a relatively new product area, standalone commercial products (including <a href=\"https://www.fiddler.ai/\">Fiddler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.superwise.ai/\">superwise.ai</a>) are available, and monitoring tools are incorporated into all the major machine learning platforms.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Separate from monitoring for model freshness, Ameisen also mentions the need to apply technical domain experience in designing monitoring systems that detect fraud, abuse, and attack from external actors. AI PMs should consult with Trust &amp; Safety and Security teams to combine the best principles and technical solutions with existing AI product functionality. In some specific domains—such as financial services or medicine—no easy technical solutions exist. In this case, it is the responsibility of the AI product team to build tools to detect and mitigate fraud and abuse in the system.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, it’s not enough to simply monitor an AI system&#8217;s performance characteristics. It is even more important to consistently ensure that the AI product’s user-facing and business purposes are being fulfilled. This responsibility is shared by the development team with Design, UX Research, SRE, Legal, PR, and Customer Support teams. The AI PM’s responsibility is again to orchestrate reasonable and easily repeatable mitigations to any problems. It is crucial to design and implement specific alerting capabilities for these functions and teams. If you simply wait for complaints, they will arise far too late in the cycle for your team to react properly.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>No matter how well you research, design, and test an AI system, once it is released, people are going to complain about it. Some of those complaints will likely have merit, and responsible stewardship of AI products requires that users are given the ability to disagree with the system’s outputs and escalate issues to the product team.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It is also entirely possible for this feedback to show you that the system is underserving a particular segment of the population, and that you may need a portfolio of models to serve more of the user base. As an AI PM, you have the responsibility to build a safe product for <em>everyone</em> in the population who might use it. This includes consideration of the complexities that come into play with intersectionality. For example, an AI product might produce great outcomes for wealthy, American, cisgender, heterosexual, White women—and although it might be tempting to assume those outcomes would apply to all women, such an assumption would be incorrect. Returning to previous anti-bias and AI transparency tools such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993\">Model Cards for Model Reporting</a> (Timnit Gebru, et al.) is a great option at this point. It is important not to pass this development task off to researchers or engineers alone; it is an integral part of the AI product cycle.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If done right, users will never be aware of all the product monitoring and alerting that is in place, but don’t let that trick you. It’s essential to success.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<h2>Post-Deployment Frameworks</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>One question that an AI PM might ask when pondering these post-production requirements is: “This seems hard; can’t I just buy these capabilities from someone else?” This is a fair question, but—as with all things related to machine learning and artificial intelligence—the answer is far from a binary yes or no.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There are many tools available to help with this process, from traditional vendors and bleeding edge startups alike. Deciding what investment to make in MLOps tooling is an inherently complex task. However, careful consideration and proactive actions often lead to defendable competitive advantages over time. Uber (the developer of <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/scaling-michelangelo/\">Michelangelo</a>), Airbnb (developer of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2018/public/schedule/detail/68114.html\">zipline</a>), and Google have all taken advantage of superior tooling and operations skills to build market-leading AI products.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Nearly every ML/AI library touts full end-to-end capabilities, from enterprise-ready stacks (such as <a href=\"https://www.h2o.ai/\">H20.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLFlow</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/\">Kubeflow</a>) to the highly specialized and engineer-friendly (such as <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon.io</a>) and everything in-between (like <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a>). Enterprise level-frameworks often provide deep and well-supported integration with many common production systems; smaller companies might find this integration unnecessary or overly cumbersome. Regardless, it’s a safe bet that getting these off-the-shelf tools to work with your AI product in the exact ways you need them to will be costly (if not financially, then at least in time and human labor). That said—from a scale, security and features perspective—such capabilities may be required in many mature AI product environments.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>On the other hand, building and scaling a software tool stack from scratch requires a significant sustained investment in both developer time and technology. Facebook, Uber, AirBnB, Google, Netflix, and other behemoths have all spent millions of dollars to build their ML development platforms; they also employ dozens to hundreds of employees, each tasked with building and scaling their internal capabilities. The upside here is that such end-to-end development to deployment frameworks and tools eventually become a competitive advantage, in and of themselves. However, it’s worth noting that in such environments, employing a single AI PM is not feasible. Instead, a cadre of PMs focused on different components of the AI product value chain are needed.</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Building great AI products is a significant, cross-disciplinary, and time-consuming undertaking, even for the most mature and well-resourced companies. However, what ML and AI can accomplish at scale can be well worth the investment.&nbsp; Although a return on investment is never guaranteed, our goal is to provide AI PMs with the tools and techniques needed to build highly engaging and impactful AI products in a wide variety of contexts.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>In this article, we focused on the importance of collaboration between product and engineering teams, to ensure that your product not only functions as intended, but is also robust to both the degradation of its effectiveness and the uncertainties of its operating environment. In the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a product release is just the beginning. Product managers have a unique place in the development ecosystem of ML/AI products, because they cannot simply guide the product to release and then turn it over to IT, SRE, or other post-production teams. AI product managers have a responsibility to oversee not only the design and build of the system’s capabilities, but also to coordinate the team during incidents, until the development team has completed enough knowledge transfer for independent post-production operation.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The evolution of AI-enabled product experiences is accelerating at breakneck speed. In parallel, the emerging role of AI product management continues to evolve at a similar pace, to ensure that the tools and products delivered to the market provide true utility and value to both customers and businesses. Our goal in this four-part series on AI product management is to increase community awareness and empower individuals and teams to improve their skill sets in order to effectively steer AI product development toward successful outcomes. The best ML/AI products that exist today were brought to market by teams of PhD ML/AI scientists and developers who worked in tandem with resourceful and skilled product teams.&nbsp; All were essential to their success.</p>\n",

      "<p>The release of GPT-3 has reinvigorated a discussion of creativity and artificial intelligence. That&#8217;s a good discussion to have, primarily because it forces us to think carefully about what we mean when we use words like &#8220;creativity&#8221; and &#8220;art.&#8221; As I&#8217;ve argued in the past, each time we have this discussion, we end up raising the bar. Each time an AI system does something that looks “intelligent” or creative, we end up deciding that’s not what intelligence really is.  And that’s a good thing. AI is likely to teach us more about what intelligence and creativity are not than about what they are.</p>\n",

      "<p>I&#8217;m not terribly interested in whether AI can imitate human creativity. &#8220;Can an AI create a &#8216;new&#8217; poem that reads as if it were written by Keats, or a new piano sonata that sounds like Beethoven&#8221; isn&#8217;t a question that&#8217;s worth asking. Of course it can—if not now, it will be able to in the near future. We really don&#8217;t need a new Beethoven sonata; the 32 he wrote are enough. Nor do we need a new Keats ode, limited though his output was. Or a new Rembrandt. Imitation is ultimately a party trick: clever and amusing, but not really important. Sure, if you want texts for greeting cards or elevator music (or maybe even commercial pop), algorithms may do the trick.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What&#8217;s really important is the transition between different forms of creativity. How do you get something that&#8217;s qualitatively new, and not just imitation? Creativity isn&#8217;t about the artifacts as much as it&#8217;s about the transitions. How do you get from Bach to Haydn? How do you get from Haydn to Beethoven? And, even within the career of a single artist: how do you get from the beginning to the end? How do you get from Beethoven&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5dL-65mKe0\">first piano sonata</a>, which sounds like Haydn, to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg9cE-ceso\">last</a>, which at some points anticipates jazz?

      "\n",
      "<p>Great artists (and yes, I&#8217;m presuming a lot with the word &#8220;great&#8221;) frequently work by defining themselves against what came before. This is particularly clear with artists of the Romantic period in Germany, England, and France. The term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism\">Romanticism</a> didn&#8217;t come around until some years later, but they left behind several manifestos describing what they were trying to do, and how it was different from what came before. That is still how artists work: Nnedi Okorafor&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nnedi.blogspot.com/2019/10/africanfuturism-defined.html\">Africanfuturism</a> is important as a way of defining and directing her own work. The importance of these defining statements isn&#8217;t so much about “rightness” (in the sense of &#8220;this is what art is or should be&#8221;) but in setting a direction for their project. Can a machine do that? Can it decide how its work will be different from what came before? It&#8217;s not clear to me that it can&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s a significant step beyond any machine learning projects we currently have.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Although artists work by projecting their work into the future, by defining something &#8220;new,&#8221; their work is also derived from what came before—possibly as misinterpretation, but almost always as revision. Listen to the Beatles, and you hear something that was really built on the backbone of blues, filtered through some British pop-cultural trends. At the end of the &#8220;His Dark Materials&#8221; trilogy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman\">Phillip Pullman</a> thanks all the authors he stole from. Or, as T. S. Eliot <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/200/sw11.html\">said</a>, “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.” Artists break from the past by reinterpreting that past.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For AI-generated art&#8211;where does that sense of &#8220;different&#8221; come from? Can artificial intelligence learn to steal and reinterpret? Where does that engagement with history, current events and even selfhood come from?  Without that, there’s no basis for reinterpretation aside from random perturbation. It&#8217;s not clear that a sense of history couldn&#8217;t come from a big model trained on a gigantic corpus (although the best we can do now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/\">build models that have no idea what they are saying</a>). What kind of model would take that corpus and make something that was different, something that hadn&#8217;t been seen before? Would we care if Hamlet wasn&#8217;t written by Shakespeare in a specific historical context, but in 2025 by a computer trained on an archive of Elizabethan politics, drama, and history? (Never mind that an archive of Elizabethan drama would be very skimpy; most plays from that period were never published.) Would anyone care about the opera <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_in_China\">Nixon in China</a> if it didn&#8217;t reflect a composer&#8217;s, and a librettist&#8217;s, thinking about historical events?\n",

      "<p>There&#8217;s another way in which I find computed-generated artworks unsatisfactory, particularly in music. AI-generated music is often interesting over the short term, but fails at larger-scale structure. Much of music history, from four-bar blues to Beethoven&#8217;s massive experiments in sonata form, is about building structures that can be interesting over the long term, whether &#8220;long term&#8221; means a few minutes of a blues song to several hours of opera. That was Beethoven&#8217;s project; more recently, it was the project of rock groups like Pink Floyd. It seems conceivable that a model could learn to generate such longer-form structures, but I&#8217;ve yet to see one that does it satisfactorily.</p>\n",

      "<p>Is this where collaboration between humans and machines comes in, and if so, what does that say about creativity? A machine could conceivably do the pattern-matching and combinatorics, assembling a creative work out of news clippings and stylistic mimicry. But a human still needs to supply the sense of history that makes the work something we care about. A human still needs to provide the structure that makes art works more than brief curiosities. Is it possible for a human could tweak a model like GPT-3 to give it that sense of direction and context? What kinds of user interfaces would facilitate this kind of interaction?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "<p>I can&#8217;t answer those questions, but that sounds like a much more interesting form of digital collaboration than having an algorithm write hundreds of dull poems or songs and “curating” a few that aren’t boring. That&#8217;s just a recipe for greeting-card sentiment and elevator music. I mean no disrespect to Hallmark—mass-produced poetry for greeting cards serves a purpose—but when we think about what kinds of creativity we want, and how that creativity will be mediated by AI, we should demand more.</p>\n",
